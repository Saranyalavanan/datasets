Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,2,"I only purchased a second-year calendar for my son because I had one for my daughter. I was really disappointed with the lack of selection available for second-year calendars in general, so I just got this one because it was one of the only ones. It's an okay calendar. The finish on the pages is glossy which makes it hard to write on with certain pens. The stickers aren't very cute and the pages are pretty old-fashioned looking. Hopefully they will come out with some other calendars for future purchasers."
"SoftPlay Giggle Jiggle Funbook, Happy Bear",2,"This bear is absolutely adorable and I would give it a 5 star rating if it actually giggled or growled like it was suppose to!  I just got it in the mail the other day and was super excited when I saw how cute it was!  If it's something as simple as a dead battery I could handle it BUT I can't even find a place where the batteries would to!  Such a disappointment....it's going back and I have no gift to take down to my new Granddaughter, Kenzie, now!"
Wall Decor Removable Decal Sticker - Colorful Butterflies,2,Would not purchase again or recommend. The decals were thick almost plastic like and were coming off the wall as I was applying them! The would NOT stick! Literally stayed stuck for about 5 minutes then started peeling off.
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),2,These were  good quality--worked fine--heavy duty--able to be used in any way needed and filled my need as no others
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),2,"While the diaper pins are attractive, the metal in the pins I received are flimsy and did not hold up to the thick fabric I used them on. Fortunately there was no baby involved, so no little on was stuck."
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),2,I really thought I was getting a dozen pins..turns out I should have counted the pins in the picture..as there are only 10. I am sad..and I think that they are overpriced. I only use them to mark yarn when I crochet so I will be going back to regular safety pins.
Modern House Trailing Cherry Blossom Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,2,I haven't put these up yet but I was disappointed in the color of the flowers. They look more purple than pink.
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,2,"This toy was given to my son by his grandmother.  I saw Lamaze and immediately thought it would be a great toy.  Not the case.My son received this fish bowl when he was about 4 months old.  He is now 9 months.  He chews on the crab for hours, but other than that not much else.  I feel that this is an expensive teething toy.I like the variety of color and the different textures of fabric the toy offers."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,2,"I've tried this for almost 6 months at different points of our kid teething and she's just not that into this. It's really heavy for a baby. When I would hold the vibrating setting on my kid would watch for a bit and even try it but just seemed bored with it and would move on. The yellow part also attracts dust and fiber out of the air like a magnet. It is ALWAYS dirty. I'm not that particular when it comes to dirt and baby stuff but it grosses me out. It's also only wire clean, so it's a more high maintenance toy."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,2,My LO is definitely teething and I've tried giving this to her but she can never get the massager to go at it on her own.  I will have to put it in her mouth and press it at the same time.  She looks at me and I imagine her thinking &#34;what the heck is that&#34; and she pulls her face away.  I'm hoping she'll want to use it again before her teeth actually come in since I can't return it at this point.  We're sticking to the fake keys and her little Sophie the Giraffe for now.
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,2,"I had this very teether for my twin boys 8 years ago and they absolutely loved it.  So, when my new baby started teething, I sought out the same teether.  I was surprised when it arrived and the packaging stated that the product is, ""safety tested"" for BPA, lead, and phthalates.  It does not state ANYWHERE on the package that it is BPA free.  As a former regulator (of medical devices) I am very sensitive about company labeling and statements.  Perhaps too much so.  But, I would rather err on the side of caution where my child is concerned, and the lack of clear ""BPA free"" labeling on this product gives me pause.  Specifically, when they test it for BPA, lead, and phthalates, is there an acceptable amount allowed?!  If not, why wouldn't the company simply label the product as BPA, lead, and phthalate free?Eight years ago, when I gave this toy to my sons, no one had ever heard of BPA.  My boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths, and I'm sure it was all riddled with BPA.  But, in this day and age, when BPA is strongly suspected of being dangerous, I cannot in good conscience allow my new baby to chew on anything that MAY contain it.  And, though someone on this site indicated that a representative from the company TOLD them it was BPA free, I'm still skeptical.  Again, why not label it as such?  Most companies proudly label their products with that simple language that cannot be confused."
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,2,"After reading all the great reviews on the sling I decided to try one.  We both hated it. Maybe because I'm 5'1 and my son was eleven pounds when he was born made it more difficult. I kept trying to make it work for us but after 6 months I gave it up. I ended up giving it away. It's not one size fits all. If you're short, think twice on this."
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,2,"I love Dr. Sear's books, but this baby sling is much too large!  I am a slightly small framed 5'5"" woman.  My 6'5"" husband wears this sling just fine.  But, for a sling to work for YOU, it MUST FIT properly!  I finally bought a sling that fit me when my son was over 1 year old.  I couldn't believe what a difference it made and felt so sad that I hadn't tried a different sling sooner. My son loves sitting in it on my hip and brings it to me whenever I am working in the kitchen. Try the Rosado sling or any other brand that comes in sizes and buy the size that fits your body!  You will really be able to enjoy the baby wearing experience that Dr. Sears recommends so highly!"
Arm's Reach Original Co-sleeper 100% Cotton White Sheet,2,I would recommend getting cheaper sheets made for a playpen. These started unraveling after one wash! Not worth the money.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,2,"When shopping around for a diaper pail I was drawn to the Diaper Champ for several reasons. 1) I loved the idea of using regular plastic bags from the grocery store. 2) The one-hand chute is quick and easy to use while dealing with a squirming baby. 3) I'd heard negative reviews about the Diaper Genie. Now that I've had the Diaper Champ for 8 months, I'm looking for a diaper pail that lives up to its name.About 2 months ago the chute began to stick and the pail began to release unpleasant fumes each time I'd drop a diaper in. The inner lining had come loose and was preventing diapers from dropping down into the bag. Eventually, the lining just fell out and that's when the smell became unbearable. Not only is my daughter's nursery filled with odors strong enough to give you a headache, the smell is seeping into the hall and down the stairs.Our Diaper Champ is on its way to the recycle bin. It won't be returning for a come-back fight."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,2,"I purchased this pail about a year ago and found out right away that it will not control Ordor for #2 diapers.  My cat box smells fresher!  So, I used it for wet diapers only until I found that my now 1 1/2 year old son makes is own deposits...his toys!  Oh and by the time the pail fills up with wet diapers, those smell too.  The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.  So, the pail is now in our storage unit and we have a wicker basket with a lid (found free at a garage sale) lined with a garbage bag that sits on our deck right outside the sliding glass door. Diaper deposits are made there where it is easy to get too, the smell is outside and it can be emptied by my husband...outside!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,2,"We wanted to have a convenient locking receptable for poop-laden diapers in our toddler's bedroom. While they do lock, they aren't convenient. Wipes get caught in the mechanism and you have to shake and bang it while trying to keep wriggling baby on the changing table. Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often. They're bigger than diaper genies, yes, but not quite big enough for a baby with a big appetite.This smearing problem, is, in my opinion, probably the source of the smell that others complain of. We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum. What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch. You'd need to open the latch before starting the change, and close it after, but that seems easier to me than thumping and wiggling a diaper champ in the middle of the change. It will control odors better, and you won't have to be continually wiping poop off the outside of it."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,2,"I was definately excited to have a diaper pail capable of keeping smells down and holding more diapers. I have two little ones under the age of two.  I was immediately disapointed to find that everytime I tried to filp the diaper into the pail, in the entire thing opened up.  I guess mine could be broken but I think its just poor design.  It also seems to be no better than the competitors at keeping diaper smells in the pail.  The plus is that it uses regular trash bags."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,2,"It works ok.  I've had it for a few months - I bought it based on its positive reviews in baby bargains, but I'm going to find something else.  The biggest drawback is that a couple days after emptying it, stuff starts getting stuck in the device so that you have to open it up and wrench poopy wet wipes unstuck...defeats the purpose of an airtight bin.I haven't compared it with other bins, so I couldn't say whether it's the lesser of evils, but hopefully there's something better out there for the job."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,2,"The Diaper Champ is difficult to use and does not contain the smell at all!!  After you turn the handle to bring the diaper down, if there are more than a few diapers in there, it gets stuck and you have to turn it a few times to get it down.  It smells pretty bad after a day or two, and this is after cleaning it with Pine Sol AND letting it air out!!The only advantage is that you can use your own bags, but what good is that if you are constantly cleaning it and spraying Lysol??"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,2,"I am really disappointed with the Diaper Champ.  It worked great at first, but then the foam seal broke and it wouldn't contain the smell.  Babies 'R Us gratiously exchanged it for another one and it happened again.  I would say it's a product default.  We always made sure the tape was tucked in, etc., but the foam liner just kept coming out.  Plus, sometimes when the diaper was really heavy and big, like in the morning when they're soaked, it wouldn't fit in the chamber and turn properly, so we'd have to jam it in there, gross!Otherwise, the champ worked well on odors and accepting diapers.  I'm pregnant with baby #2 and will look into other diaper pails."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,2,"I like the slim shape and that you can use regular tall kitchen bags with the Diaper Champ. BUT, it really isn't that great in controlling odor. Sometimes diapers get stuck in the ""flipping tube"" and then you have to open it and pull it out... what a mess! It isn't all that easy to clean either."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,2,"After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ. It was highly recommended by a new mom with an infant. Big mistake, her baby as well as most of the people reviewing this positively are using it with their INFANTS, so their diapers do not smell like that of a one or two year old toddler!!!!!!!!  The Genie does a much better job of masking the odors, Yes, it is more cumbersome in terms of changing out the plastic....but that I can live with.  The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,2,"This is easy, but horribly smelly.  I suggest saving your money and buying a regular trash can.  You will get the same effect, because this doesn't do anything special."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,2,"I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.  You are better off just getting a garbage pail with a tight lid.  Not only did my daughter's room smell horrible, but I broke three finger nails trying to lift the lid."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,2,"... than deal with the odor from this pail.  Even changing the whole bag (we tried plastic grocery sacks, tall kitchen bags, even heavy duty garbage bags) every day didn't help.  We've moved this product to the garage and purchased a Diaper Genie for the nursery."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,2,"I LOVED my Champ for the first year as it was all I expected in ease, cleanliness, odor free with regular bag changes and the economical use of kitchen bags.  Then the liner began to come loose and get stuck in the tumbler and eventually had to be removed altogether making things a bit less odor resistant, but still manageable with regular bag changes, cleanings, airings and sprinklings of baking soda.  The real problem we have now is that no amount of cleaning and deoderizing the Champ after a bag change (about twice a week for us) has managed to eliminate the strong odor that seems to be clinging to the actual pail now.  We've tried a number of disinfectants, deoderizers and air freshners, but they are no match for the offensive odor of the Champ even when clean and empty.  We are so disappointed in the short-term success of this product.  It has been removed from my son's room and we are now taking each diaper out individually and looking for another pail.  I am really interested in finding another &quot;use-any-trashbag&quot; style for sake of our finances.  In light of our experience with the Champ, I'd have to recommend not purchasing this pail unless you are prepared to replace it when it fails to do it's no-odor diaper duty in due time."
