Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book,5,"This is a product well worth the purchase.  I have not found anything else like this, and it is a positive, ingenious approach to losing the binky.  What I love most about this product is how much ownership my daughter has in getting rid of the binky.  She is so proud of herself, and loves her little fairy.  I love the artwork, the chart in the back, and the clever approach of this tool."
Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book,5,"All of my kids have cried non-stop when I tried to ween them off their pacifier, until I found Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet.  It is an easy way to work with your kids to allow them to understand where their pacifier is going and help them part from it.This is a must buy book, and a great gift for expecting parents!!  You will save them soo many headaches.Thanks for this book!  You all rock!!"
Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book,5,"When the Binky Fairy came to our house, we didn't have any special gift and book to help explain to her about how important it is to stop using a pacifier. This book does a great job to help prepare your child for the loss of their favorite item. The doll is adorable and we made lots of cute movies with the Binky Fairy telling our daughter about what happens when the Binky Fairy comes. I would highly recommend this product for any parent trying to break the pacifier or thumb sucking habit."
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log",5,"Perfect for new parents. We were able to keep track of baby's feeding, sleep and diaper change schedule for the first two and a half months of her life. Made life easier when the doctor would ask questions about habits because we had it all right there!"
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log",5,"A friend of mine pinned this product on Pinterest so I decided to give it a whirl! It is fantastic! If you are a new parent, this will help you keep track of feedings, diaper changes and the like!"
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log",5,"This book is perfect!  I'm a first time new mom, and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, sleep.  Definitely would recommend this for new moms.  Plus it's small enough that I throw in the diaper back for doctor visits."

Nature's Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar,5,"I love this little calender, you can keep track of all of baby's firsts. I like the illustrations, and the stickers too."
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,5,This was the only calender I could find for the second year. I did one for the first and wanted to continue cause there are so many things to note still after they turn 1. This one was better than the first year one I got him.
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,5,We wanted to get something to keep track of our child's milestones and this is a cute option. There aren't many other choices out there and this does exactly what we wanted.
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,5,"I had a hard time finding a second year calendar, this is the only one I came across and it is great!  Large enough to write in the squares and has a spot to put that month's picture in as well as some memories. The first two years they change so much I like to jot everything down so I can keep track of all the big milestones...and little ones!  I find it is easier to do this on a calendar vs a baby book.  This way you can fill out the baby book later and have a great reference to do so!"
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,5,I LOVE this calendar for recording events of my son's second year of life.  There are plenty of 1st year baby calendars out there and I loved reocording events of his first year and didn't want to just stop now that he is one.  Nature's lullabies second year calendar is perfect for continuing on with daily record keeping.  The stickers are wonderful and helped me think of milestones to record that I might not have thought of on my own.  I highly recommend this calendar!  Plus it's super cute and brat for either gender.
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,5,"Wife loves this calender. Comes with a lot of stickers and options to mark the firsts. Includes spaces for milestone photos as well. Sticker borders for photos, etc, it is just a very easy to use scrap booking option. Especially for new moms who dont have enough time to actually sit down, and haul out a ton of scrapbook supplies"
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,5,My daughter had her 1st baby over a year ago. She did receive and fill up a First Year Calendar. When her son was nearing his first birthday she was looking for a Second Year Calendar to record his milestones. Thanks to Amazon I was able to get this for her and she LOVES it. Tender sweet art work - helpful stickers - unique pages to fill. A nice keepsake. A wonderful gift for a one-year old!
Baby's First Journal - Green,5,"Extremely useful! As a new mom, tired and inexpedient, not remembering how long ago baby ate, this definitely helped me through the first two months."
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",5,I like how the book has a hook to attach it to your stroller or car seat - it wont get lost.  Great way to go over family members.
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",5,Beautiful little book.  A great little short story saying I Love You....Keeps the attention of the baby and then the baby can actually turn the pages and hold on to it when you are finished interacting with it.
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",5,This book is so worth the money. It says 9+ months on the box but I can't wait for my baby to be born to try to use it before. It's so cute and very interactive! There are flaps to open on every page.
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",5,"we just got this book for our one-year-old and she loves it.  It's so nice that she can't bite chunks out of it like she can a board book or rip it like a paper one.  She can chew on it, pull on it, and carry it all over the house!  She loves the little flaps that open and is learning simple words like ""daddy,"" ""mommy,"" ""puppy,"" etc.  We love it."
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",5,What a great book for babies!  I'd been looking for books which couldn't be damaged by my 10-month old's drool...so cloth or plastic books were my options.  This book adds another level to your usual cloth book--a fun flap or moving part on every page.  This interactive book is perfect for my baby!
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",5,"My son loved this book as an infant.  It was perfect because he would chew on his board books and destroy them, but this one we didn't have that issue.  I love the Lamaze series, they are a lot of fun not only for the child but for the parent.I liked that this book was not only teaching my son about Peek a Boo, but we used it to learn names for family members like grandparents, sister, cat, dog etc.  And of course with it being a lift the flap book, that was additional fun for my son as well.  He's nearly two now and he doesn't look at it as much, but he still does enjoy reading it and playing with it now and again.  I'd say out of all the Lamaze books, this one and Discovery Farm are his favorites."
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",5,"Our baby loves this book & has loved it for a while now ... He enjoys when I read it to him, and enjoys playing with it on his own."

SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,5,"My baby absolutely loves Elmo and so this book seemed perfect for her.  I'm happy to say I was right:  this book is nice and soft and beautifully illustrated so my little one takes it everywhere and ""reads"" it all of the time. While Elmo is the main character of because he hides on each page, other Sesame Street characters are also featured which is fun, too. Another great, interactive, Elmo centric book that I would recommend for the Sesame Street/Elmo lovers is ""Twinkle, Twinkle Elmo"" (which is also available on Amazon for a great price)."
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,5,"I bought two for recent baby showers!  The book is soft and interactive, great for any baby, and the bright colors are beautiful.  Lastly, who doesn't love Elmo!"
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,5,"My 3 month old son loves this book. We read it over and over and he smiles and laughs every time we find Elmo and say &#34;peekaboo Elmo!&#34;  We have a few different soft books and this is the most colorful and fun to read. And baby adores it, so 5 stars for sure."

"SoftPlay 4 Pack Block Book, Sweet Sesame",5,"Bought for granddauchildren and they play with them all the time.  Love reading to them.  Soft, so if they fall on them, they are safe. When they use the Elmo book, the kiss Elmo.  Got when they were 9 mos, now they are two and we are still having fun with them.  They love to see how high they can stack the blocks before it falls over.  I buy as a baby present."
SoftPlay Baby's First Cloth Books Gift Set,5,"It is so hard to find cloth books with ACTUAL images on them! So many have unrealistic portrayals of what animals/objects look like, but this one is fantastic. EXACTLY what we were looking for!!When we teach our 1 year old what a ""lion"" is, we want to show him a REAL lion... not a drawing that looks nothing like a real lion."
"SoftPlay Cloth Book, Hugs",5,"for the young child, very cute...so happy they can &#34; read&#34; something there is little or no chance of them destroying..many happy reading memories"

Baby's First Year Undated Wall Calendar with Stickers to Mark &quot;Firsts&quot; - Pink,5,I searched high and low for a first year calendar and settled on this one based on the reviews.  I am so happy that I did.  Perfect for jotting down quick memories throughout the month and remembering dates of baby's &#34;firsts&#34;.  Will be fun to look back on.  Also has spots for personalization and pictures.
Baby's First Year Undated Wall Calendar with Stickers to Mark &quot;Firsts&quot; - Pink,5,This is a very good gift for a new mother.  You would want to give it to the parents as soon as baby is born so that they can start from the very beginning to chart the &#34;firsts&#34;.  I had one of these calendars for each of my five children.  They enjoy looking up their &#34;firsts&#34; especially as they are now parents themselves.
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,5,
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,5,Absolutely love it and all of the Scripture in it.  I purchased the Baby Boy version for my grandson when he was born and my daughter-in-law was thrilled to receive the same book again.
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,5,OMG.....we loved this baby book! Perfect for the memories you want to remember when your little one gets bigger and starts asking questions. It even had a place for foot and hand prints for when your baby is born which is the main reason why we liked this one. Also it has pockets for keepsakes and little places to put first locks of hair....etc! So cute and is a great baby shower gift!
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,5,"Beautiful book, I love it to record cherished times in my great granddaughters life with the beautiful pastel pink color."
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,5,"Really happy with this purchase. I was looking for an english baby book (I'm French and the daddy is Flammish) and this is the perfect one. Lot of info to fill in : family, firsts...and mini pockets to preserve hair, maternity bracelet...Really happy!"
My Kindergarten Year - A Keepsake Book,5,"I was pleasantly surprised upon receiving the memory book entitled,  ""My Kindergarten Year"". It is the perfect way to record one's Kindergarten experience through photographs and detailed descriptions of this very important time in your child's life. The questions are fun for your child to answer and record while serving its purpose for the parent.I'd recommend this book to everyone with a Kindergartener."
My Kindergarten Year - A Keepsake Book,5,I'm so glad I stumbled upon these gem. My son has already started answering questions and I think it will be a great memory to look back years later to see how he answered the questions.

Modern House Winnie the Pooh Swing and Tiger Swing (2 pages) removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,5,I could not get these Winnie the Pooh themed wall decor stickers in New Zealand and these were a very cost effective option that I was very impressed with.  They were easy to stick on and look fantastic on the wall - they don't &#34;look&#34; like stickers at all.  Very professional and very seamless on the paintwork.
Modern House Tower of Pisa Italy removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Wall Decal,5,"Very satisfied about the product, grat design, it came as ir said on page.  I highly reccomend the product, and I follow buying more."
Blessed By Pope Benedict XVI Divine Mercy Full Color Medal,5,very nice Divine Mercy Pendant of Jesus now on chain around my neck.  Love It!  Divine Mercy represents Jesuswho offers us an ocean of divine mercy.  Pray to God for our country. You need HIM in your lives!
Reusable Flannel (15) Baby Wipes 100% Cotton Bleached and Unbleached (Flushable Diaper Liners),5,I love these wipes.  They are so simple and soft and they are a great price for reusable wipes.  They actually get my baby clean and dry during diaper changes.  And I know that I'll find a million other uses for them after our diaper days are done.  I'm ordering more of them right now!
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),5,A great safety pin that has lots of uses.  Easy to find with bright colors and a great bargain for a dozen.
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),5,"These diaper pins went to Honduras to hold the cloth diapers we also sent with the missionaries. It is difficult to find diaper pins in our &#34;disposable&#34; age. In Honduras, they do not have &#34;Pampers&#34;. They appreciated the kits we sent."
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),5,"It has been many years since we needed diaper pins, but I do like to pin my socks together through the wash and have never lost one yet. I was using brass dressmaker pins but they tended to open up during the wash cycle. My wife suggested diaper pins and we tried them. Thery're working perfectly and staying together through the washing. Matter of fact they can get a little tricky to open, but of course that was the idea. Recommended to keep your socks &#34;friended up&#34;."
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),5,"As another reviewer noted, these are great for matching socks before washing.  Now once the socks come out of the washer, I hang them to dry with the pins still on.  The socks stay on the line to dry without clothespins, they just hang with one sock on each side of the line.  After they are dried, I just open the pin and leave it by the hamper on a shelf.  As I put dirty socks into the hamper, I grab a pin and use it.  Has saved a lot of time and I don't have the problem of lost socks or mismatched socks on my feet.  Great idea and am glad I read about this here on the reviews.  Wish I had done this my whole life."
Blessed By Pope Francis Franciscan Knotted Our Lady of Grace Italian Made Aurora Borealis Crystal Rosary,5,"I ordered this Rosary for a friend because it looked lovely in the photo and it is blessed by Pope Francis.  I was not disappointed as it is just beautiful, made with crystal, and knotted in between the Our Fathers.  I am giving this to my friend along with a copy of the novena of Our Lady Untier (or Undoer) of Knots, for whom Pope Francis has a strong devotion.  I definitely recommend this Rosary and would buy it again in a heart beat."
Blessed By Pope Francis Infant Jesus of Prague Nino De Praga Medal Charm Pendant,5,An excellent value and quality for the price.  Just right for wearing around the neck orattaching to a Brown Scapular or some such. And the Blessing makes the Item all the more Precious.
"IKEA KLADD PRICKAR Bib, blue, red",5,"This bibs provided very good protections for messy eaters, my grandson is a 20 months old beautiful boy who loves to eat his marinara pasta with his fingers. My daughter loved this bibs, pasta elbows or curls fall in the front pocket when missing the mouth. Easy to wash too."
Holy Family Baby Jesus and Star Nativity Christmas Tree Ornament,5,"This is such a cute ornament, I collect nativity ornaments and this is perfect for my collection! Can't wait to add it to my nativity tree!"
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",5,We used this to help us keep track of pees and poops during that first month. It is really helpful if you breastfeed to keep track of feeding patterns and wet diapers to make sure baby is eating enough. Great book!
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",5,"This book is going to be a life saver! We are adopting and when we travel complete the adoption, I needed a book to keep track of baby's schedule. I have a terrible memory and this book will be perfect for keeping track of baby's schedule. I also love how there is a spot at the beginning for emergency numbers and important info. Perfect for traveling, the babysitter or just for at home use. I will definitely be buying more after I fill this up."
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",5,"Love it love it love it!!  Got my first baby tracker as a gift, bought another one as soon as it was used up.  Great for daycare, too, so you can communicate with your provider about baby's activities for the day.  Also great for round the clock care- no need to ""remember"" when baby ate last or how much sleep you really got!!  Get it for your new moms- to- be!!"
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",5,"Of course this has been a great/easy way for me to record all of my baby's routines and a simple way for his caregiver to let me know how the day went.  What I really love about it, though, is that it was so easy for me to jot down all of his major milestones as they happened.  I knew that I wouldn't have time to work on his baby book in the beginning (and sure enough I didn't even get it out until after 2 months), and because I had this book I was able to finally transfer everything over.  Life saver!!  All of the funny little things would probably have been forgotten!"
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",5,"I am 4 weeks from delivery of my first baby and was looking for a newborn tracker. From the reviews I read this one looked like it had everything that one needs to write down and remember, so I bought it. I have not used it but I am very happy with what I saw. Hope it ends up being as useful at it looks."
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",5,"We found this book at a rummage sale and found it to be so useful, especially when several people are helping with the baby (ex: visiting family, etc.)  We loved it so much that I've bought another one and have almost filled that one too.  I like having the room to write things about our baby's day and development, plus use the ""Notes"" section to write some story, etc.  It also helps ""Dad"" see what has happened that day and feels more connected.  I will be buying another one soon!"
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",5,I got this baby tracker as part of the 'new parents' package from my work. It is extremely well organized ... much better then others I've seen. It is an iParenting Media Winner and for a good reason. Absolutely worth the $$. I am getting this for all my expecting friends! 5 starts!
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",5,"I'm a new mom and I was looking for something to record my baby's daily activities and patterns and it is perfect! It has a lot of space to write down anything extra beyond the diaper changes, feedings and sleeping. I like that it has an area to write down medications. It is a great reminder for dr appointments and to track your baby's patterns. I am extremely happy with this book and will be ordering another one for when I run out of pages in 3 months."
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",5,Love this book ....super easy to keep track and sooooooooo helpful for this first time mom ..especially for pediatrician appts
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",5,I loved how this book was set up to keep track of everything important about baby.  I used it for the first year.  I always took it to doctor appointments to share how often she was eating and everything.
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",5,I've been using it since I have my newborn and it's a great way to keeping track of baby&#34;s schedule
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",5,"This is the best way to keep track of when your baby eats, sleeps, poops, gets a bath, etc. It's also a great way to keep track of which side baby nursed on. I took this to all infant doc appt. And it's a great gift!"
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",5,"I rarely write a review however, this journal has been a lifesaver.  Sleep deprivation can compromise anyones ability to recall feeding and napping times, which breast was last used, soiled diapers, etc.. I even sleep with my journal to keep it close by so I can document around the clock.  The layout of this journal is very simple and easy to use at a quick glance.  I understand there are phone apps that do the same thing however, I chose this journal to allow my husband and nanny to have access to the information.  A must have and will make a great gift."
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",5,I received this at my baby shower and it has been a wonderful gift. I had no idea when I received it what fun it would be to record all this information. I have done this for 2 children now and only wish I would have had it for my first 2 kids.
"Large Jungle Animals (Panda, Lion, Elephant, Gorilla) - 3D Wall Murals for Baby Nursery and Kids Rooms - Made in USA",5,I ordered these for my 7 month old sons play area.  They are very cool.  I love the fact that they can be removed from the wall and moved to a room or house if needed.  I would get these instead of wall decals because they are 1. easier to put up and 2. can be moved without ruining them.  It makes his play area look really cool!
Edu-Petit Happy Jungle Day Finger Puppet Book Developmental Toy,5,My 2 year old grandson got it for Christmas and he loves when his Mommy reads it to him.  Good quality and very well made.  Other positive reviews directed me to buy it.
Modern House White Plum Blossom with Green Birds Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,5,"a little difficult if you dont know how you want it to be placed on your wall, so be creative, it comes off easily so you can play around with it.. the result looks beautiful. very peaceful."
Modern House Giraffe Children Height Measurement Growth Chart Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,5,"It is now haning in my granddaughters bedroom. I did think it was larger though, but still happy with my choice."
Modern House Safari Animal Family removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,5,"the instructions were really clear, howerver the next day the decals started coming off because my wall has ridges on it soooo. I added a little dab of crazy glue and walah! it's up."
Modern House Safari Animal Family removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,5,The designs were cut and easy to apply. There was no sticky residue when we peeled it off to readjust and it was to redo the adjustment again and again. It was also just sticky enough to stick to the wall while not too sticky enough to peel the paint off. We like it.
Modern House Angry Bird I removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,5,"Grandchildren opened these before they got home and stuck them to everything in my house, even themselves. Hope they will still stick on wall when they get home."
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,5,My daughter started playing with her Music Blocks set when she was just a few months old.  She spent hours entertaining herself.  She is now 18 months old and still loves this toy.  Now she understands how to arrange the blocks and has great fun making new musical patterns.  I highly recommend the Jumpin' Jive Jazz cartridge -- it's her favorite -- and the Bach cartridge when you want calmer music.
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,5,"It takes a youthful spirit of inquiry and fascination to play with blocks and pre-programmed music. Anyone too old to play with blocks (or to young to play with them again) may back off. But they're missing a revolution in interactive toys. Each colored block represents part of a musical score, and each side on the block represents one way of delivering that piece, such as horn, violin, or voice. Turning and swapping blocks thus generates changes in the music played, with incredible variety. You (and, oh yes, the child too) will run out of steam long before you run out of interest. And the use of additional block sets expands the use and interest even more. Bravo!!"
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,5,"I spent [a lot of money] when this thing first came out, and it worked TERRIBLY!  I sent it back to the company because it was defective and wouln't shut up.  They sent me another one.  It worked very inconsistently.  When I called the manufacturer I was told ""Well, it's a very sensitve computer, you can't just let them toss it around, that must be why you're having trouble""  Actually, I was having my 2 year sit in his high chair while I supervised him, and he was not doing anything to it.  I mean, it says it's for 2 year olds on the box....  Anyway, I returned it and got my money.  SAve your money for real music lessons."
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,5,Recently I have purchased the musical mozart blocks set for my two and a half year old daughter at a toys r us department store near me as a Christmas gift for her this year and they had one of the toys out on display. She loved the toy and it is very educational. I had a hard time leaving the store because she wanted to continue to play with it although she is young enough that even though she was with me while I purchased her toys for Christmas this year that she had completely forgotten about it and that I haought this toy for her. My only complaint is that I had to pay [$$$] for this toy and they had told me that the sale on the toy had ended yesterday but this toy I knew was still available online here for [$$$] which is a really good price and I do not think it is right for them to sell it for the other price when it can be bought cheaper. Anyways I liked the toy alot and my daughter did too and that is why I purchased the toy even at the price I  had to pay for it. I think it will get a lot of use out of it and so will my 8 month old daughter when she is old enough as well.
"Milestones, Kids' Step Stone Kit",5,Product was very easy to use.  I helped my son (16 months at the time) make a stepping stone for Father's Day.  He put the stones in himself and it turned out really cute.
Sesame Street Baby Purse Playset,5,"My girls love this Sesame Street purse! There are 5 items that can be placed inside of the purse. They use it when they pretend to go shopping around the house. It was a little tricky for my 18 month old to figure out how to open it but she eventually learned. The bright colors, durable design and sweet Sesame Street character faces make it such a fun purchase!"
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,5,"My one-year-old baby loves this toy!  She loves to take the fish in and out, and watch through the transparent sides as she takes them in and out.  She loves to play peek-a-boo through the sides.  She loves to shake/squeeze each fish to hear its noise.  Downside: the fish are easy to misplace, so keeping all four together is a challenge."
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,5,"I bought this toy to help stimulate my eight-month-old's development. When I got it in the mail, I immediately opened it and gave it to her. She has been playing with it since. Her favorite is the crinkle crab because she can make him make noise. She is fascinated by the others. She very quickly learned how to take them out and put them back into the bowl. She has had no difficulty in doing that. Great item, worth the money!! And it is so fun to watch!!"
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,5,"Everyone knows nap time can be difficult, my daughter fights it everyday, sometimes she'll even jump around and hit the sides of her crib. We decided putting some of those cribside toys made of hard plastic was unrealistic at this point, however I saw this and got it right away.Although we had tried stuffed animals and other soft toys this works he best. It's a lot more interactive compared with just hugging her teddy bear. Everyday she plays with it, it also occupies her in the morning when she first wakes. I walk into her room and there she is holding her fishy. Plus if she rolls on it during the night there's no chance of hurting herself. She loves it.Great value! Something a little different."
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,5,This is a very good toy that helps manual dexterity and the ability to recognize figures behind the clear plastic. My baby girl especially loves the crinkle crab and the clam !
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,5,We first bought this toy for our oldest child when she was just beginning to sit up and play with toys.  She would sit in her crib and play for a hour or more just putting the sea creatures in and out.  It gave Mommy shower and make-up time!  We believe she loved the clear plastic on the bowl and the shape and feel of the pieces.  We had the same experience with daughter #2.  We have bought this several times for other new parents.  Our girls have also received similar toys (not Lamaze) ex: a cookie jar and have not enjoyed it anywhere near as much.  A little toy with big entertainment value!
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,5,"I saw this toy before I was pregnant and though it was so cute!So after I had my daughter, I had the best excuse to buy it!!!She loves it.  I bought it for her when she was about 3 months old.  She'd chew on the little clam.  Now she uses it to learn that they make noise, and she can put them in and take them out of the bowl.It's worth the money.  Cute, educational, (quiet.. heh), and durable."
Pedal Farm Tractor,5,"We chose this tractor and trailer for a family gift for our two-year-old son and he loves it!  Visiting friends love it, too.  We looked at several others, but this one seemed to be the safest and most durable.  He cannot pedal the tractor yet, but loves to push it around or be pushed while sitting on it and will soon grow to it (he is tall).  The trailer is a great addition and our son loves to fill it with toys (or his little brother!).  The only negative is that the ""hitch"" for the trailer does not lock in place and can be turned causing the trailer to come off at bad times, but we would still recommend it.  The assembly was easy and our little farmer has been thrilled!"
Pedal Farm Tractor,5,I bought this for my son when he was 3 years old.  He is now 8 and handed it down to my younger son when he turned 2.  After 5 years of rough and tough riding it is just now starting to break down.  This has been an awesome toy.  We also purchased the trailer and the boys have loved them both.  I think it would have lasted even longer if my 8 year old would have stayed off of it after he had outgrown it.  Anyway the only thing you need to keep in mind is that there is no brake so be careful on hills.
Pedal Farm Tractor,5,"We bought this tractor to accompany the trailer.  Our grandsons are big into farm stuff and love to load up the trailer and pretend they are working """"on the farm.""""  It is best for those old enough to reach the pedals (age 3 and up?).  It is very sturdy and durable.  Great toy for those busy toddlers and preschoolers.  Worth every penny it cost!"
Pedal Farm Tractor,5,"We bought this tractor for our 2 and a half-year-old son, and he is able to pedal and manuever this vehicle very well, despite the recommended age of 3-6 years. This tractor is very sturdy, and nearly impossible to tip over. My son has deserted all other riding toys in favor of this tractor. I highly recommend purchasing the yellow trailer that is specifically made for this tractor, but is sold separately .... My son loads all kinds of treasures into the trailer and farms the yard for long periods of time...."
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,"We bought these for our son when he turned two. He had seen them at a playmate's home and LOVED them. I liked them b/c unlike some of the other cars for sale...there is some learning value and they are VERY durable. They have been thrown, rolled, stepped on, etc and still show no signs of wear. Highly recommend!"
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,"My son loves stacking cups, so a friend recommended this toy to me.  My son loves it and he enjoys pushing them around the floor.  They nest nicely into each other, which makes it a great toy for the diaper bag."
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,"My son Cameron just loves these great little stacking cars!  He enjoys stacking them and slapping them down and each has great little things that they do such as his fire truck has a ladder that clicks up and down, police car has a spinning &quot;light&quot; bar, and so on.  I think it's great, brightly colored and has great little faces....I would give this as a gift in the future, not a wasted toy, Oh the little wheels roll, too!"
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,"My one year old son received these as a birthday gift. He loves them. Not only are they stackable, which helps with hand-eye coordination, but each car has individual moveable features. Although these features are small, they got his attention. The bright colors are nice also. They are a great buy for the price!  I highly recommend them as first trucks for a small child."
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,I purchased this toy for my great grandson's first Christmas. He will be 6 months old. I can't wait to play with it with him. This is the first baby in our family for 18 years and all the family is waiting for the fun... I will be ordering a lot more soon. Thank you for the convenient shopping. AJ'S Gee-Gee (Great Grandmom)
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,"These are a huge hit with my one year old son.  We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born.  He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We've traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don't take up much space since they nest.  The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands."
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,"This is a great toy.  The wheels really work and each car has a special feature.  They store easily for packing on trips and putting away.  Both of my kids (boy and girl) have played with them.  They are brightly colored.  And best of all, these do not use batteries!"
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,My 11 month old received these last Christmas and he instantly began running them along the floor and playing with them. He is now 22 months and I have taught him his colors using these and he STILL loves to play with them.  One got run over by an electric scooter and it didn't even break! All parents should get these for your baby.  This is the one toy that will NOT sit and collect dust!
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,My 14 month old son loves to stack and play with these little cars.  They are durable and easy to clean.  I throw them in  the diswasher and they hold up great.  They are well worth the money to me.
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,"Great toys, we always pack one or two in the diaper bag, our 7 month old loves to play with them and I don't worry at all about him chewing on these toys as there are only smooth surfaces"
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,After being inundated with toys that require batteries and make so much noise this was a breath of fresh air. My son loves these vehicles! We got this when he was 6 months old. We stack them on top and he loves to knock it over. We nest them and he loves to find the surprise vehicle underneath. Now that he is 8 months old he is figuring out that the wheels move as well as some of the other moving features on each vehicle. I highly recommend this toy.
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,We bought these trucks for our 15 mo. old daughter and 4 mo. old son- We love them!  They are nesting which is fun for our daughter to look underneath the trucks to find the next one or they can stack one on top of the other to make a tower.  Perfect first trucks!  And they aren't too big- a perfect size!
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,My son got this stacking truck set as a baby gift.  He was able to play with the trucks at about 6 months and they are still played with today (my son will be 2 next month). The overall durability of this toy is great; they look as good as when we got them even after lots of play and being taken along on many trips. I have not seen this toy in any store - so get it here while you still can!  It has been a much used toy and I highly recommend it for your small child.
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,"My daughter loves these vehicles. She likes to watch them disappear as you stack them inside each other. And she loves to stack them atop of each other. Then she plays with them as cars, and even makes the sounds they make. They are wonderful fun toys, and great to take with you on trips, they are compact!"
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,My son loves this stacking toy. It is much more fun than the stackable rings toy even though he does have that one too. All the boys at our baby group have it and the babies who don't always come up to see what it is all about! You can't go wrong with this purchase.
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,"Okay, well they don't really beep.  (But my 11-month old son loves when we roll these along and SAY &quot;beep beep!&quot;)  At this point, my son's favorite aspect of these cars is the little sunroof, siren and ladder on the tops.  He can sit there for ten minutes just flipping the sunroof back and forth!  Go figure!  These cars are super sturdy and have taken quite a beating on our coffee table.  (They're in much better shape than the coffee table at this point.)  I love that they nest together so they don't take up too much space when they're put away.  I also like that he can grow into them once he understands the nesting/stacking part better.  A great toy...gets played with each and every day!"
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,"For well over a year my son has enjoyed stacking and playing with these cars. They have held up brilliantly to his abuse - they still look like new. Fun to stack, fun to roll. Clever toy that has been a winner with my son since he was one."
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,"We just bought this for my 9 month old daughter,she loves these cars, loves to turn the wheels and lookat the faces. She especially loves the little green car,it's the perfect size to fit in her tiny hand and it rattles.This toy is a hit! I highly recommend it."
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,5,"This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item."
Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control,5,"My mother-in-law bought 2 of these for our twin boys-- one for each crib-- and they have been a life saver in getting our boys to settle down at night and go to sleep. Now our boys do not sleep without it! Anytime we are going somewhere overnight, we take at least one with us. It is also the only toy that plays music by itself for more than 30 sec. It will play for about 10 minutes!! It's our standard gift for all of our parent friends."
Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control,5,"My daughter had this in her crib until she was 2 and loved it.  When she got old enough she loved to turn it on and off by herself.  I used this every night for her to go to sleep by. I used the place that you store the remote control in for extra pacifiers, so if she lost one during the night she would know where to find one.  I never used the remote, but loved the idea another had about putting in the car for rear facing infants when they get fussy you could just turn it on with the remote.  It's not too bright and the volume is adjustable.  Someone had said it eat batteries quickly,but I found that they lasted a very LONG time and I used it EVERY night. I highly recommend this product!!"
Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control,5,I bought this product when my son was about 10 months old.  He was still having problems going to sleep at night and naptime.  The Slumbertime Soother is great.  I sing along with the songs.  My son turns it on himself and sometimes just plays with it.  The nature sounds relax him.  I really like the fact that it plays for ten minutes without stopping.
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,5,"My son is nearly a year old and received this toy about 9 months ago.  We both love Sassy toys.  This one is bright and amusing.  Stick it on a car window, high chair tray, restaurant table, bathroom tile,...  We were disappointed in the life of the suction cup, but for all other reasons--color, amusement, education, and co-ordination--get one of these!"
Sassy Smiley Face Rattle,5,"This toy is very cute, it has two handles for little hands to grasp, a mirror on one side and on the other the smiley face! the face has wiggly eyes and a nose to beep. but the nose can be frusterating for babies as my 18month old son still has a hard time beeping it! my all in all a cute,durable toy!!"
Sassy Circle Rattle,5,My son (who is now 2+ yrs) loved this rattle as a baby.  He loved it so much that I have given it to all of my mommy- friends as a gift.  This is the best toy to have for a young baby.  You will get them to smile for those all-important-photos with this one!!
Sassy Circle Rattle,5,"Both of my sons love this toy. My two year old played with it when he was a baby, and it found its way to the bottom of his toy box at Granny's. We found it about a month ago and his 5 month old baby brother began to play with it. Suprise Suprise he loves it too! And his big brother tries to steal it away. This toy is durable, and fun. What more could mom ask for??"
Sassy Circle Rattle,5,"What I don't love about this is that the clear part, where the baby can watch the beads move with motion, contains BPA.  However, my daughter found this rattle a comfort to her while teething and chewed only the big protruding ball, which as far as I know is free from both PVC and BPA.  I thought she would like the textures of the rings, but nope, it was all about the ball.Also appreciated the bright colors.  This is a good bang for your buck baby toy -- for a while there we always had it in the diaper bag when we left the house.Best at about 6-12 months.  Can't see it getting a lot of use before 3 months and just not interesting to a toddler, even a toddler who is still teething."
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,5,"I was concerned about the chemical content of this ""plastic"" book since a baby will undoubtedly stick it in his mouth. I emailed Sassy and got a reply saying that this was BPA, PVC and Phtalates free. I can breathe a sigh of relief when I hand this to our baby...soon!"
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,5,"We bought this for our 5 month old and put pictures of relatives that live far away inside the pages.  The book is very sturdy, &quot;chewable&quot; and has a lot of great colors/designs to look at.  Now at 8 months, this book is still one her favorites!  Plus she sees her grandma's and grandpa's, etc, faces every day.  We love it."
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,5,I bought this for a new granddaughter.  I will not get to see her often as she lives in another state.  This book is great for out pictures and she can carry it around and look at the pictures as she would a book.  This way she can recognize us when we show up.  It is easy to carry and cleaning it is simple.  It is a great little photo book.
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,5,"I originally bought this for my 4 month old son, but my 17 month old daughter has taken it over.  We filled it with pictures of mom and dad, 2 sets of grandparents, and all the cousins with their families (there are only 6 slots for pics, but we took pictures of entire families - so we have 20 people in all).  She loves pointing to the pictures and identifying various people.  The pages are made out of thin plastic material and filled with foam, so are pretty soft, but still durable. The slots are sized for 3x5 inch pictures.  My 4 month old hasn't gotten much out of it yet, but I'm sure he'll love it just as much in months to come."
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,5,This is a nice photo book for babies as it has clear plastic sleeves to protect the pictures you place inside.
Earlyears: Earl E. Bird with Teething Rings,5,"We received an Earl E. Bird as a gift when we had our first baby eleven years ago. Since then, Earl has seen us through teething for three kids, and is still in good condition for our fourth baby!  He's a little faded around the edges, but just as loveable and soft, with difference textures for a chewy, drooly baby to gnaw on.I like that he's fully washable, and a nice quiet toy (at least in ours, the squeaker was very quiet to begin with and has since kind of stopped squeaking--but the squeaker was never the big attraction with Earl).  Perfect for taking on planes, or in church, or in the car. A great baby shower gift, since Earl is perfect for a boy or a girl."
Earlyears: Earl E. Bird with Teething Rings,5,"This little toy is safe for infants, and offers great color, texture and even sound.  Very Sweet, though a little pricey."
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",5,"a wonderful learning tool and made very well so little hands cant rip it apart., my grandson loved the different colors and fabric,"
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",5,This is exactly like the one I had when I was a kid. My son really enjoys it and it keeps him entertained.
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",5,"I had a book similar to this as a child and it brings back wonderful memories! My 20 month old struggles with several of the items, such as the shoe laces and snaps. But he loves the zipper and the Velcro shapes and the other pages give him a great way to learn and practice. Overall it's an item that he can grow into and it's super cute!"
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",5,"My daughter enjoys taking it apart more than putting it back together, but a great product.  It has kept her occupied while flying."
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",5,I bought this for my grandbaby for Christmas. She loves it and my daughter kept saying it was such a neat toy.
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",5,My 8 month toddler enjoys this book. Very good idea with mind-stimulating activities on each page. Well worth it for the price.
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",5,"Well made and quite a few different textures.Toddler loved this book and Mom approved, too.Everyone was happy with this selection."
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",5,"Just what I wanted, but did't have the time to sew myself! Love it! My granddaughter  just loves playing with this wonderful book."
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",5,"I really like this book. You can show your baby shapes, teach her how to use buttons, zipper and snaps, tie a shoe and tell time. My baby is too young for most of these activities at this time, but she already loves to play with this book. I see a lot of quality time spent with this book in the future."
"North American Bear Company Sleepyhead Bunny Blue, Blue Stripe, Medium",5,"This is a perfect baby gift:  washable, no parts on which to choke, snuggly, VERY durable and best of all you can give the same gift to all children in the family, by just monogramming an ear."
"North American Bear Company Sleepyhead Bunny Blue, Blue Stripe, Medium",5,"My 3 year old son goes EVERYWHERE with Blue Bunny. This is his 6th one since he was born. Considering the amount of time he spends with Blue Bunny, they are probable pretty durable - I wash them about once a week. The great thing about him is there is nothing that can hurt my son on Blue. He is so soft and cozy. Great friend for small children."
"North American Bear Company Sleepyhead Bunny Pink, Pink Stripe, Medium",5,"Although I haven't seen it, my 2 year old niece loves it and that's what matters, so all is well :)"
HABA Piro Clutching Toy,5,This is a HABA toy that I have given as a gift many times--it is a very intriguing baby toy--Can't wait to give it to my first grandchild(Boy) due on June 16th
Big and Small Chime Ball by Sassy,5,"This is an iteresting ball that my baby has loved from about 6 months to 18+ months.  The chime is pleasant, not annoying and this ball is easy for a baby to pick up and manipulate.  It is my understanding that the Sassy line is BPA and Phalate free, so you dont have to worry about your child putting this toy in her mouth."
Big and Small Chime Ball by Sassy,5,"This toy is a hardier toy than most, I found it is a great toy for my middle sized parrots who love to play with balls with bells in them. So far this toy has lasted almost a year now."
Pooh Baby's First Tigger,5,Perfect for young children and overall good quality for the price.
Pooh Baby's First Tigger,5,"I actually got the ""Pooh"" one which for some reason is not advertised on babiesrus.com/amazon.I believe that toys like this sometimes are more for the parents as opposed to the babies, but still it is a cute toy!  It went with my newborn son everywhere we went because it fit perfectly with him in his carrier and it was a cute, small toy we could use to interact with.  At 9-months-old he's not at that age where he's hugging, chewing, just all out playing with his toys and he likes it for that reason.  But babies need more that just stuffed animals.  He's obviously much more interested in toys that make sounds or light so his Pooh mostly stays in his room with the other 'dolls'.This is still a cute item.  I haven't had to wash it yet, but it sure is durable."
Pedella Wooden Push Toy,5,"This is a must have for any toddler!  I bought one for my brothers triplets who were 1 1/2 years old at the time.  They loved it!  One would push & the other 2 would chase after it.  They love watching the duck waddle & its feet go round & round.  Best of all, no batteries!  Yaayyyy!!Fifteen years ago, I bought my daughter a little push clown from the same company.  It was her favorite toy & was passed onto her brother.  With heavy playing by 2 children it never lost any of its paint or parts.  It's something we are saving for grandchildren one day."
Infant Stim-mobile,5,"Love this mobile!  It is challenging and their eyes are drawn to it.  My son couldn't look at it until he got older as he didn't like high contrast, but at @ 7 mo he got into it.  If you are a parent who appreciates observing the small nuances of learning that occur in the development process--you will be able to witness it with this toy.  I'm not a parent trying to turn my children into geniuses, but definitely into maximizing their capabilities to incite their own curiosities.  Keeping children zoned out is not a priority--so for those who want to do that--turn on the tv and buy toys with bells and whistles.  For others, get toys like this one."
Fisher Price - Baby Bowling,5,"Cute toy, durable and is simple. Nothing sings, light up or dances...just what our kids truly need. Everything talks, spins, lights up....it is hard to find SIMPLE stimulation toys that kids have to manipulate themselves. This set challenges kids mentally as they try to figure out a. how to roll a ball b. how to aim the ball c. how to knock the pins down d. how to pick up the wobbly little guys. also you can tell your child 'aim for the red guy' or 'aim for the yellow guy'. great for teaching basic colors and counting too. don't forget you can always say WOW you knocked ONE over...and so forth. great all around and gets tossed around too so clearly after using for a month and being bashed on teh floor by little hands trying to figure out how to bounce the not bouncy ball (exploration) nothing has broken."
Rattlesnake Squirt,5,"Not that==> I &lt;==would -- ever -- do it, or recommend it, but there is a gag called theRattlesnake Eggsprank.It is nothing more than a simple mechanism hidden in an envelope that says:""WARNING: RATTLESNAKE EGGS. KEEP AWAY FROM HEAT TO AVOID HATCHING!""I can just picture someone putting a few of these prank envelopes in the backseat of""somebody's"" car next to one of these snakes. The first slight bump -- while driving --will produce a r=a=t=t=l=i=n=g sound which should MORE than just shake someone upwhen they look behind them and noticethe SNAKE!What an excellent, cruel, gag. Not for your parents---or grand parents---for OBVIOUS reasons!"
Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,5,"This product was very innovative when introduced in 1997-8.  It sold at FAO Schwarts for about $100 and we got it for our 18 month old daughter.  She used it until she was at least 3 (we then moved to Reader Rabbit).  The way it worked then -  you plugged the key board into the printer port and the sw was on two CDs. The keyboard did not require mouse skills, just visual selection of very large buttons.  Very interactive, very educational for the toddler/preschool set.  The developer was Israeli and they did not have good US distribution.  It now seems that they finally found someone to distribute it."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,"all three of my kids have had one of these teethers, and it's been the favorite for all of them. i buy one for any expectant friend or family member. in our experience, the batteries last about a year & 1/2."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,One of my friends recommended this for me for my daughter when she was teething. It was the only thing that made her stop crying when she was teething and I tried everything imaginable. I had to hold it to make it vibrate because her mouth wasn't strong enough but it made her so happy and cuddly that is far from a complaint. Have recommended it to lots of my friends and they all love it.
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,"Great teether as it has a good texture, is easy to handle and massages the gums while baby is chewing on it."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,"I ordered this product after reading many of the other reviews, and I'm also pleased with this purchase. My daughter is 10-months-old and her first tooth just came through, and we'd tried everything to soothe her gums: ice cubes, teething rings, cold washcloths, you name it. At first she wasn't terribly interested in the toy, but then I took it and put it in my mouth and handed it back to her. She put it in her mouth, and I squeezed the other side to make it vibrate. The look on her face was priceless! Her eyebrows went up and I noticed she bit down harder (so I could let go), and she seemed to really like the vibration. This has since become her go-to toy when her gums seem to bother her. Also, I discovered she likes to have the little roller on the handle rubbed up and down her back. All in all this is a really well made toy that worked for my daughter exactly how I'd hoped."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,my 5mth old daughter really likes this teething toy. it has just the right amount of vibration and it triggered easily enough where she can activate it herself with little effort. i like that the 3 sides of the star have different ribbing so it feels different on her gums. great product for the money and a must have for a teething baby.
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,"My 10 month old grandson thought the movement of this toy was funny! He laughs when it moves! Saying this, he does put it in his mouth but pulls it out to laugh So, I love this Teether because it makes him so happy NOT because it massages his teeth!"
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,"It is a great toy for them to chew and play with, but it is a bit harder for smaller babies to chew on. The vibration was a bit stronger than I was expecting, but it does not seem to bother my son a bit."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,"My daughter is two months and loves this in her mouth.  She seem to like the points and the softer rubber than theInfantino Vibrating Strawberry Teether.  Also it requires less pressure to make vibrate.  No she is not teething yet and no she cannot make it vibrate yet.  But if you pinch it for her, their are three different point surfaces and yes she has her favorite.  If she is getting a bit cranky, there are times this will turn her back into all smiles.  At this point, she seems to ""chew"" and vigorously suck on the points."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,"A must in addition to all the teething toys. Next to Sophie the giraffe this is his favorite. I. Don't really know if the vibration massages. His gums, but he does enjoy biting into it a lot!"
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,"My little guy loves his star teether! It's great entertainment for him, and he likes the opposite spinning side too. It was easy to introduce to him, and easy to clean too!"
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,"The yellow part vibrates once little gums/teeth chomp down on it. easy to hold on to, can easily hook (Via rings or carabiner) to a diaper bag etc. Both my kids loved it while teething."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,My son is 4 months old and can not quite get a hang of other teethers. Some of them you have to bend in a specific direction to make the vibration happen. This teether is great. They just bite down (naturally) and the vibration helps with the comfort. I love it!
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,This arrived the next day after I bought it and I was very grateful!  We had one other one that my son managed to lose and he was miserable without it!  It really helped soothe his mouth while he was teething!
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,"My son is obsessed with this teether!! He was first more fascinated with spinning the bottom part and chewing on that but after 4 months of having it, he has now switched and loves the rubber/vibrating part. I don't know what I would do without this one, I think it is a must have! Not only a teether but a toy as well :)"
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,"I bought this for upcoming teething, and we still don't seem to be there, but my baby just thinks this thing is good fun.  She bites on it and the vibration cracks her up.  That's enough for me!"
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,My baby loves the vibrations on his teeth. He also shakes it like a rattle. This product is good quality.
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,I've bought several teethers and this i one of the best ones. The vibration helps ease the discomfort and the colors make it also very interesting.
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,"I know it's a safety feature, but it is unfortunate that the batteries are not replaceable in this, because I will probably have to buy another one of these soon, because my little one LOVES this.  He seemed to hate all other teething options out there...even Sophie he had to learn to love (he's does like it now), but this he gnaws away on vigorously.The star shaped chewing part is a little big and that worried me a bit when I first got it, but it actually hasn't seemed to bother him that much.  So far (he got this at 5 months) he can't always make the vibration happen himself but, 1)It's not that difficult for me to just push down on it as I'm holding it for him since I like how it calms him down and 2) even when it doesn't vibrate, he still loves to chew away at it.  He has learned over time a bit better about how hard to bite down to make it go too and that it will go by chewing on any of the three available &#34;tips&#34; to the star.He also really likes the little spinning rattle on the end and it has little nibs that he likes to chomp on too (even though it is hard plastic and the star is rubber like).  It is a &#34;substantial&#34;  toy though, so if your little one is in the phase of swinging toys around really hard, they may bonk themselves now and again, but our son seemed relatively un-phased by that."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,I got this for my son when he was about 8 months. he loved bitting it and he carry it all over the house. He is now 18 months and it still works plus he still bits on it too. I found it very easy to clean too.
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,"If I can recommend one teether to buy for your teething baby, it would be this one. The vibration made it fun and it took the edge off for my little guy. The shape/handle made it really easy for him to hold. We never leave the house without this thing and it is the go-to gift I give to all my expecting friends."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,"Baby loves this teether. Nice to have something different from all of the other teethers out there. The nice thing is that when she no longer wants it to vibrate, she still has fun the with handle the spins. Great product and it has lasted despite being thrown all around."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,"I had bought a similar toy like this in the 90's for my daughter when she was teething and now she has children. I bought one for my grandson, then more recently this one for my granddaughter. Babies love the sensation it gives them when their front teeth are coming out and making them miserable. I believe it relieves them of some of their pain and I highly recommend any parent with teething babies to get this toy for them! It is a sturdy product and you don't have to worry about any little parts coming loose or damaged. My babies and grandkids abused theirs and it still took the beating."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,"We have another vibrating teether that is very similar to this one, there are some differences though.This one is much softer on the outside which could be nice on tender gums.This one has 3 points that she can use to pin point the problem area.Each point has a different texture (bumps, ridges) so there is some varianceThis one seems like it is easier to activateI will say that I don't know if she favors one for the other.  It seems like she uses them both about equally.She also likes to play with it by making it vibrate on her hands, feet, cheeks etc.  We have had a lot of fun playing with it.It's a great find and I wish I had come across it sooner."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,"This is great, my son loves it and it's pretty easy for him to hold he enjoys the vibrations when he chews on it."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,5,A favorite in our house!
The First Years Soft Teething Beads,5,"This teething ring is great!  We probably have enough toys to have our own toy store, including at least 2-3 of these teething rings! Our 10-mth-old baby loves to stick one of them in his mouth (like just one bead of it) and walk or crawl around with his hands free to hold other toys.  Our 7-mth-old, loves it too, with his favorite game being to simply have one of us sit it on his head and then wait for it to fall off when he moves.  He thinks it is hestarical.  It's amazing how much fun they can have with such a simple toy."
The First Years Soft Teething Beads,5,My daughter loves this and it keeps her happy for a long time.  It is also very easy to wash to keep clean as well.
The First Years Soft Teething Beads,5,"My baby loves to play with this during bath time! It's easy for her to hold, bite and play with!"
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,5,"I used this sling for both of my babies, (0-&gt; 2.5yrs). We had a front backpack style which was good for about 3 months, until the weight of the baby started to make my back ache.The best thing about this sling, besides the fact that the kids loved riding in it, is that it folds up into a reasonably size bundle that fit in my diaper bag. So as the kids aged, and wanted to walk on their own I could just toss this carrier in the diaper bag for when they got tired. Also with the kid riding either in front or on your hip, they are very accessible, so that you can hand them something, like a bottle or a bit of food when you are on the go. (Say like walking around at the Zoo.)I must admit I liked the hip carry position best, it mimic's having my arm under their butt, and holds them close.Anyway its reasonably priced, you'll get your use out of it, (unlike the front only carriers, which as I mentioned aren't good for very long, or the backpack carriers, which while are good for that heavy load, don't pack up and so aren't with you when you need them.)"
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,5,My Grandson is super fussy and I used this for my own son. Put my Grandson in this turned on the vacuum and he was out like a light! He looked just like he was back in the womb!Thank goodness I still had this as it is no longer available. What a great product!
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,5,"I am the the mother of a 14 week old who has reflux and is uncomfortable sleeping in a crib or anywhere flat. She wants to be held *all* the time, and it was getting pretty exhausting in our arms (and my chronic tendonitis was flaring up) until we ordered the sling after reading about it in Dr. Sears's The Baby Book.  I had my doubts, but boy has it been a lifesaver!The sling has been invaluable for me, my husband, and our regular sitter. With it, we are able to walk, bounce, give the calming pinky finger treatment, and see what's going on with the baby. She started using the sling at 2 weeks, when she was about 7 pounds. It took a few times, but she is now completely comfortable in it and it is a favorite napping spot.As I am large-breasted, I did find it awkward to breastfeed in it, although I've been able to do it successfully a couple of times in public sitting down.  The fabric is soft and easily washable (important for those baby mishaps).  The padding helps me feel comfortable as a bit of protection in case of bumping.  The size is very adjustable for different height people, although you may need to pull through a lot of fabric to bring small babies in tightly, especially if you have a smaller chest size.The NoJo sling would benefit from having some loose fabric at the end to cover the baby's head in the sun and provide more coverage during breastfeeding. The stopper piece of plastic at the end of the fabric adds safety (it won't pull through), however it can whack the baby if you aren't careful when getting it on or off.  It could also use a zippered storage area, a feature of some other slings.  Also, the blue with plaid seems to be the only fabric sold these days, although I have seen other patterns and colors on eBay.  This is fine with jeans, but not great when you have to go to a wedding, as I did with the sling earlier this summer. I think it also makes people think that she's a boy, for some reason.  Maybe it's the blue and the fact that they can't see her cute dresses!The sling is also helpful in keeping interested strangers at a slight distance away from the baby -- they are less able to grab at her, which I think is good from a germ perspective, especially for newborns. When it is very hot or humid out, this sling can be a bit heavy for the baby (especially up against a hot mama!), but on cooler days the fabric adds just the right amount of warmth, like a light blanket.When I was pregnant, I assumed the Baby Bjorn would be all we would need. Instead it hangs on a hook most of the time unless we're going for a long walk or shopping -- activities where having two hands is important and you'll be doing them for a while. That thing is so hard to get on and off! Plus, you aren't supposed to use it until they are 8 lbs. The baby seems to really like the flexibility of positioning with the sling -- especially curling up happily in a womb-like ball -- and sometimes gets irritated by being all dangled out in the Bjorn.Carrying the baby in the sling makes you so much more mobile than using a stroller or lugging her around in her heavy carseat, so I use it whenever I anticipate being in public where they are stairs, space issues, or other impediments.  It's good for short shopping trips as well, especially if you're with a friend who can carry things or push a cart, both of which are harder to do with the sling on.She's also a million times more comfortable in the sling than in her car seat, where she often cries.  Our NoJo Babysling has been in constant use since it arrived, and ties the bouncy seat (where she mostly sleeps by day) as the best return on investment of any of the baby gizmos we bought.  Our sitter will often wear the baby for her entire nap. The sitter just sits (often in a rocking chair or porch swing to provide some more movement) and reads while the baby sleeps.One last thing that's great is that when the baby falls asleep, she can be laid down on the bed or bouncy chair and the sling just slips off the wearer without waking the baby.I did not watch the video, but did read the sling chapter in the Baby Book, which was helpful. We have recently started using the kangaroo (facing out) position as the baby loves looking at the outside world now. It's nice to have this sort of flexibility.  If you are getting tired carrying around your baby, and would like an extra hand free, a sling is a great investment and while not the most elegant, the NoJo is a good workhorse one to use on a daily basis."
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,5,"We purchased the Babysling when our daughter was 2 weeks old.  I was looking for a baby carrier that I could wear while nursing her that would be comfortable and discreet.  Initially, I found the sling very awkward to use.  I wasn't able to master nursing her in the sling until she was 2-3 months old.  However, as a carrier the babysling was great from the beginning.  Our daughter was colicy, and being able to put her in the sling all cozied up to either myself or my husband, hands free, was a God send.  This calmed her 90% of the time.  As the months went by, being able to wear her in the sling enabled me to get housework done without baby crying to be picked up - she was already up, and was able to be &quot;involved&quot; in my daily activities this way.There are many different ways to wear your baby in the sling, and that versatility has made it one of the best baby product purchases we made.  Our daughter is now 2 1/2 (30+ lbs.), and when she's having a rough &quot;toddler day&quot; will still occasionally ask for the sling.Be patient with the sling.  Practice with it, and if you can, find a friend who has used one successfully.  Dr. Sears also has a whole chapter on using a sling (any sling, not just this brand) in his book The Baby Book - great photos in there to help get the hang of things.One last remark... I have a friend who tried this sling and was unable to get it tight around her body (she's very petite).  There are other brands of slings (Maya Wrap, Over the Shoulder Baby Holder) that come in multiple sizes that might allow for a more customized fit."
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,5,"This sling is the third baby carrier I purchased, when the first two highly-promoted products were too uncomfortable.  My son was a premature baby who needed to be carried a lot for the first few months.  After we purchased this sling, my son basically lived in it!  The variety of cozy positions were perfect for his needs, and the sling fits so comfortably on both my husband and me that we don't even feel the weight of the baby when he's in it.  In fact, the weight of the baby is so evenly distributed that you don't develop the shoulder strain or lower back sway that other products gave us.  We would recommend this sling to anyone with a newborn or premature baby, and we continue to use it now that our son is a big 6-month old baby.  Buy it!"
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,5,"I got a regular carrier as a gift and I hated it! The baby would slide down in it, even though it says its for newborns. I have two other children and had to attend open house at two different schools. The first open house I had the baby in the carrier and it was awful. I ended up taking the baby out of it. My breastfeeding consultant told me about the sling an I went out and brought it right away. It is the best thing I could have ever got for myself and baby. The second open house was so much easier. The baby just bald up like in my womb and slept for the whole two hours. It was also great because I had both hands free to meet and greet the teachers. It comes in handy for breastfeeding discretly in public which for some moms is a must. The baby would sometimes get upset when taken out of the sling. I would recommend the sling to every mom every where!!!!!!"
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,5,"I have four children and have seen the benefits of the sling first-hand in varied situations.  My first was very small, and as a newborn, I thought he seemed lost in the sling so I exchanged it for a front-pack carrier.  Now I know that you can put a blanket or such in the sling to help cradle a newborn more securely.  It was a lost opportunity for us.  With the arrival of my second child, I decided to give it another try, as many of my friends raved about theirs and I'd need my hands free for my first child still.  I found the sling to be great for nursing, and afforded me privacy when I had to do so while out and about as I could pull the sling's fabric right over the baby and cover us both.  For a tired baby, it is much more conducive to sleeping than an upright carrier, and you can slip out of it and lay the baby down while still in the sling, if necessary.  My third child was (and still is) very cuddly, and enjoyed being next to me.  Since a mom's arms tire after a while, I found the sling a great way to incorporate baby into my routine without wearing myself out.  My fourth child turned our world upside-down with a very colicky start.  The &quot;insert-in-sling-and-go&quot; method was the only way to settle him down.  I could nurse, cook supper, do whatever I needed to do while keeping him close and moving, which was the key.  He learned to relax and even sleep while I was doing all sorts of things and making quite a racket at times.  Now at nearly three, he'll fall asleep while I'm driving and I can take him into the house, remove his coat and shoes, then carry him upstairs to bed without disturbing him.  I believe his learning to relax and sleep in the sling with so much going on around him has helped him in this area, too.  Most of all, it is just nice to have that close time with your little one in the sling, even if you are busy with other things to do.  I can't promise miracles, but this sling has been a crucial part of our early parenting and I recommend it highly!"
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,5,I disagree with all of the reviews that say one size does not fit all. My Husbad is 6&quot;4 I am small frame 5&quot;2 and all we had to do when switching was move the adjustment. It was quite easy. We bought this after having the others. But they spread our daughter legs too far and she wanted to lie down at times not sit up. It was great because she could sit or lie down. And when she was very fussy it was the only way to get her to sleep. We then just slipped it off and put her down. IT was Great! Now that she is older I no longer use it but it was such a life saver I could not bring myself to get rid of it.  I not only recomend this but Dr. Sears book to anyone who has a fussy baby.
Arm's Reach Original Co-sleeper 100% Cotton White Sheet,5,"This is a must for anyone who is buying the Co-Sleeper, it adds comfort and you can easily clean the surface your little one is sleeping on buy simply switching out he sheets. The Co-Sleeper comes with one, but in the middle of the night it is much easier to switch a sheet than have to wait for the other to finish washing."

Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,5,If you have problems with Sassy paint please call the CPSC.  1-800-638-2772.  Let's get on top of companys that feed our kids paint.
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,5,"A friend of mine gave me a stroller she wasn't using anymore and the toy bar, my Daughter hasn't been able to stand a stroller since birth (she's 6 months old now) and when i put her in this, the toys keep her amused for longer than 10 minutes so I can actually walk around a mall and not be carrying her while i'm pushing a empty stroller! I had no idea the ladybug on it was a snack holder, I wouldn't be putting anything in there, The stroller I have the Tray comes off so I just put the toy on it without the tray. but it the straps do loosen up on it, so I am every once in awhile Straightening it.I do reccomend the toy to anyone who has a baby like my daughter! i'm very happy with the toy!"
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,5,"I bought this on a whim to keep my 4 month old happy in his stroller.  Otherwise, I would be holding him while pushing the stroller!  Well - he is now 9 1/2 months old and STILL loves it!  He bites on the wings of the bee and chews on the bug attached with fabric.  He doesn't ever seem to tire of this toy and I've been on marathon shopping sessions with him lasting a few hours!!  I would recommend this to everyone as one of the must haves for under 12 months!"
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,5,"We have this stroller bar and it ABSOLUTELY fits on the Graco strollers!  We have the Graco Quattro Tour system and this toy bar has been on it since we took my son out of the car seat carrier.  You need to put the velcro on off to the side and then slide it on to the main section of the snack tray.  It takes maybe 1-2 minutes to attach and then you never need to touch it again.  My son loved to look at it when he was 4 months and loves to play with it now that he is one year old.  The only complaint that I have about this toy is that the snack cup bug comes with an insert that is supposed to look like legs when the cup is closed.  It tends to fall out so i just took it off the toy.  Other than that, this is a great product and will occupy your child during long stroller trips."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,Excellent diaper disposal unit.  I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).  I am soooo pleased with this product!!! A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"We love our diaper champ.  It is very easy to use just drop the diaper in and flip the top over.  No need to stick your hand inside.  No hint of an odor, even when you are putting another dipaer in.  When it gets full, just put in a new trash bags.  The best feature of all is that even the most curious little ones can't get into the diapers.  Before we found the diaper champ, we had another diaper pail and our son learned to open it and pull the diapers out.  That is no longer a problem!!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"Two girlfriends and two family members put me onto this diaper pail.  They each had tried the Diaper Genie and had horrible results with eventual smells, and costliness of buying proprietary DG cartridges.  My family members eventually started bringing every dirty diaper out to the trash and leaving just wet diapers in the DG, that is until they found out about the Diaper Champ!Wow, what a difference, it seals in orders very well and using normal 8 - 13 gallon trash bags makes it economical.  The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.  Also, it needs to be away from the wall a little bit, so that it's flip top access lid locks into place and doesn't plop back down, but when engaged, the top will stay open so you can get at the bag of diapers within without having it fall onto your hand.We keep a little can of Oust nearby, spritz it before opening the top, grab the bag at it's neck to close off stinky odors, lift it out, twist it at the top and secure it with a twist-tie, and away we go to the garbage can.  And we take antibacterial wipes and run them around in the plunger area on both sides, voila, it's clean.At 3 months, we change the bag about 1 - 2 times a week.  Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.  I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.  Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!! I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'  In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!  I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.  For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!  Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.  SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.  Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,I am so glad I got the Diaper Champ instead of the Diaper Genie!  You can use pretty much any plastic bag - even a grocery bag will do in a pinch.  My baby is 6 weeks and I have never smelled any odors at all from the Champ.  I especially like the way you close it - you just flip the handle and that's it.  The Champ is definitely the best.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"This is the very best. So much better than Diaper Genie. No doubt about it. I would never buy Diaper Genie again. As a matter of fact I threw them out. Here you have No Refills to buy, much easier to empty and put in a new garbage bag, a lot cheaper and most of all a lot quieter. The Diaper Genie is so loud when putting in a diaper in the middle of the night that is a pain. I highly recommend this product. In regards to smell?.....excuse me there are diapers in there, not roses. Like the lady below said a Clorox wipe with some Lysol and your set to go. If you're still picky put in an airfreshner."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"Diaper Champ or Diaper Genie? That was my dilemma when registering for gifts before my son was born. Lucky for me, I had my Mom with me. She runs a daycare and said Diaper Champ is the best by far and that's what I went with. The fact that you can use regular trash bags instead of special cartridges was very appealing to me. Now my son is 6 months old and I must say this thing is GREAT! The only time I catch any smell at all is when I change trash bags. I use those Glad trash bags that are scented to prevent odors and that makes a difference, too. it is very easy and covenient to use and I highly recommend it. The only thing you need to watch is the opening latch is a bit tricky (I broke a nail the first time I used it, but then I got the hang of it). I am glad for this, though, because if it's not easy for me to open, it won't be for my son, either."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"Although I had a Diaper Genie from my first child, which I hated, I registered for this for my second.  I received very few items from my registry but this was by far the best gift I received overall. It is very easy to operate.  My 4 year old feels a part of the diaper changes because he can work it.  It keeps the smell out which makes mom and dad happy.  But, by far the best thing about the Diaper Champ is that it takes regular trash bags so you don't have to worry if [the store] will have the refills.  It is definately a people pleaser!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I bought this for my church nursery room. At home we use the First years product, which isn't bad but not as good as this one.There are a couple of occasions that dirty diapers were left in it for a week but i didn't know because it didn't smell till I opened it to change the garbage bag.I think this is the only diaper pail that is cheap to use yet does the job well.Highly recommend."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I recently gave birth to my third child.  When I had my 1st 11 years ago, I got a Diaper Genie and it worked okay, but the stupid refills for it were so expensive that I soon gave up on it.  Not to mention that the ""sausage links"" of diapers it created were pretty gross and I still had to use a garbage bag to dispose of them.  With this baby, I decided to give the Diaper Champ a try.  I LOVE IT!  In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.  I agree with any reviews that suggest using scented garbage bags, as it DOES smell pretty awful when you empty it, and I think the scented bags would help that a little.  So far I have had only a minor complaint, and that is that it can be a little tricky to open sometimes, but overall it's still a great product.  I would definitely buy this again and recommend to a friend."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"My husband & I had received a tip from another parent that this was the must have item.  I had always hated that the diaper genie had to have special bags, I was just going to get a regular garbage pail & use that.  That is until we heard about the Diaper Champ.I absolutely love it.  It is a complete life saver all around.  No special bags to buy, not a hassle to put together.  Comes almost all the way assembled out of box just attach to base & voila you are ready to start changing diapers.  A little tip to keep the odor down.  I wipe it out with antibacterial wipes a couple of times a wk, & I spray Lysol disinfecting spray.  Once a month I wash it out with a mild dishwashing detergent.  Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.  It is a sure winner.  You'll save a lot of money by using this one."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I don't know how we survived the first year without the Diaper Champ.  My daughter is now 13 1/2 months old and we still have an odor free nursery.  It's very economical, too.  Using regular kitchen bags and holding more diapers than the competing diaper disposal system makes this quite efficient.A trick that was passed down to me from an experienced mom to control odor (again, yes, it's going to smell a little...you put stinky diapers in it!):  Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use.  I don't know why the dryer sheet works...but it does!  And if I don't change it out regularly (about once every few weeks) then I start to notice the smell.Recommended above all other diaper pails!  Price-wise the Diaper Champ just can't be beat."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"We originally had the diaper genie which we found to be a pain after the top broke off twice and all those replacement specialty bags we had to buy were getting expensive but not controlling the odors.  All that sausage shaped smelly garbage eeeewwww had to be put in another garbage bag just to get it out of the house!  My sis-in law had the diaper champ & I couldn't believe she even had any dirty diapers around...there was no smell!  We chucked the genie and bought the champ. It was so much easier to use...just roll the diaper into a little ball and drop into the hole on top, flip the handle and bye bye smelly diaper (my 16 month old can do it) And there were no special bags to buy, just the same regular garbage bags we used already in the kitchen. Experienced parents will understand and appreciate that it comes apart for easier cleaning for those times when it may become a mess.  We had a problem with odors after about a year of use so I called BabyTrend to see what they recommended.  They sent me these replacement sponge gaskets (free of charge) and we were once again odor free. Now on my 3rd child and almost 3 years later, I just called them again to get another set of replacement gaskets (again free of charge) they will be here in about a week.  THIS IS A GREAT ITEM and the company stands behind their product (even years later!)"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I didn't want to get the Diaper Genie because of the expensive refills needed to use the product.  The Diaper Champ uses 10 or 13 gallon trash bags (or you can recycle larger store bags to use in the Champ).  The mechanism doesn't let odors out and if you have toddlers that get into everything, they can't get into the Diaper Champ!  Opening the Diaper Champ is easy but could be an initial challenge for some but once you figure it out it's simple to open.  I highly recommend the Diaper Champ."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,I wasn't sure which to get between this and the Diaper Genie. I am so glad that I chose this one. I love that I can buy the scented bags of my choice. It really holds in the horrible diaper smell. I love it and wouldn't trade it in for anything.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"This is on my list of must haves.  The thing has been in my bedroom for 6 months.  Not once have I ever smelled an odor from this thing.  I love that I can use any kind of bag so I just buy those super cheap super flimsy tall size garbage bags.The only drawback, as with all diaper pails, is that as the baby gets bigger and the diapers get bigger, you have to change the bag more often.  Our baby is 6 months and we fill it about once every 36 hours.But still, I wouldn't trade it for the world."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I've been using this diaper pail for 2 and 1/2 years and I LOVE it.  I can buy inexpensive scented bags from the grocery store and I just use recycled grocery bags to wrap-up the poopie ones.  My son's room has NEVER smelled at all!I do lysol it every once in a while.  But that's all I've had to do.When I'm at friends' houses that have the diaper genie, I've been confused about how to use it.  No one has ever been confused about how to use ours.  Just put it in and flip.I have recommended this to all of my friends and family."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"It suprises me to read all of these reviews saying that the diaper pail stinks up a room!  DUH! It's full of dirty diapers.  Personally, we never had that problem too much.  The nursery smells a bit sometimes but I think you would have that with every diaper pail.We got this one because we use cloth diapers and don't want each one mummified in it's own cocoon.  I used this for my first two kids.  We threw it out when we moved but now that the third is here we are going to get a new Diaper Champ."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"Diaper Champ is great.  But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop.  So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I registered for the Diaper Champ after seeing the reviews and I cannot talk enough about it. I just live it!!! It is odorless(so far) and very easy to use - and only with one hand, so you can SAFELY keep the other one on your baby. It's very easy to change the bags, which you can use any 13 gallons one - no expensive refills to buy!!!! I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,You really can not appreciate this device until you've used it.No smell unless you don't empty it for a week or more. An airtight vault it's not....but it does what it's designed to do very well.Who doesn't take out the trash more than once a week ? Same concept with this diaper pail.- From a Dad of a Newborn who's thankful he ignored the negative reviews.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I am glad my friend told me about the diaper champ, because otherwise I would have gone in for the diaper genie. This is cheaper than the genie for one, and works just as well in terms of trapping odor. It is also bigger than the genie, and the best part is, you can use regular garbage bags in them. Isn't that just PERFECT? Love this product, and would highly recommend it to any parents-to-be."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,I Loved this product. It kept smell to a minimum and could use a regular size trash bag.  Highly  recommend.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"This product meets all my expectations. The diaper champ is easy to put together. It keeps odors in the container. Most importantly it uses regular 13 gallon bags! By the way, keep a roll of these at the bottom of the container for that day when it fills up.  Depending on your use you could go for a week without emptying it out."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"This is my first baby so I have nothing to compare this product to. But I have heard horror stories of stinky diaper pails. My baby is now six months old and the only time I smell her diapers is when I change them and when I open the pail to replace the bag! I use the same garbage bags that I use in my 13-gallon kitchen trash can! It's so simple and user-friendly it's ridiculous! Put in a trash bag, old plastic grocery bag, yard waste bag, whatever; put down the top, you're ready to go. The top acts like a chute and whisks the dirty diaper away. When full pop the top (hold your breath), pull out the bag and put in a new one. No jamming or any other kind of technical difficulty whatsoever! And, again, no leaking smells. Don't waste your money on anything else!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"As new parents, we started out with the Diaper Genie because everyone told us that we just *HAD* to have one.  While the Genie did a decent job at keeping the odors inside (except when emptying it!), it was a pain in the neck for older family members to use (e.g. grandparents) and those refill cartridges start to add up after a while!A friend with a child the same age as mine showed me her Diaper Champ and I was thoroughly impressed!  Not only did it do a comparable job at keeping odors inside, it was extremely easy to use and did not require me to spend an additional [$$$] each month on refills.  We decided to go ahead and buy a Diaper Champ because our son was only 13 months old and we figured he'd be in diapers for at least another year so we'd be saving money after 6 months by not having to buy the refill cartridges.  Then when our twins were born, we were so glad that we had the Champ!  After all, we're already buying tons of diapers, who needs to spend another [$$$] a month on those Genie cartridges?!As for ease of use, my 3.5-year-old son loves throwing the dirty diapers away for me because all you have to do is drop it into the chamber and flip the lid.  It is super easy to empty it too.  And I've found that if I use scented garbage bags and give the inside a quick spray with Lysol each time I empty it, the smell when emptying it is not as bad as it is with the Genie.I HIGHLY recommend the Diaper Champ!  And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"My husband and I love the Diaper Champ. It holds a nice amount of diapers,contains the odor and it uses your own garbage bags. The Diaper Champ is easy to use and to empty, it really is a wonderfully designed product."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,We originally registered and received the safety 1st pail- what a disappointment.  the latch never worked- we purchased this pail and what a wonder!  my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).  I have recommended this pail to all my friends and they love it as well!
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,I was told not to waste my money on a diaper pail because it didn't do what it claimed to do.  Finding out it was a genie diaper pail I read the reviews of the diaper champ and decided to try the champ.  I couldn't have spent my money any wiser. Their is never an odor and I always wait until it is completely full.  Convenience of not buying new bags is wonderful!!  This is great for my 10 week baby's room-Love it!!!!!!
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"With my second child I wanted something better than the Diaper Genie which I did not like at all, it was smelly and impossible to do with a one hand action.  Enter the Diaper Champ! After reading all of the customer reviews here I decided to try it and everyone was so right.  I can put poopie diapers in this diaper pail and it doesn't smell at all! It holds a sufficient amount of diapers and needs no special bags, just regular garbage bags. I has an easy one hand action to deposit the dirty diapers leaving one hand free to hold the baby with. I am totally pleased with the Diaper Champ and hope everyone gives it a try, its worth the money!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"Let me just say, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!  I used the diaper genie from the time my daughter was born until the time she was 16 months.  That was all I could take.  Constantly buying expensive refills, emptying it every couple of days, juggling a wiggly baby while trying to open, lift, push, spin, and close the genie was just too much.  Then I was shopping at Babies R Us and in the STORE's changing room is the Diaper Champ.  It was easy, didn't smell, and used regular trash bags.  I was sold.After using the Diaper Champ for 2 months now, I am confident I made the right choice.  Yes, when it gets too full, you have to change the bag or the weight will get stuck (duh!).  Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).  Yes, poop does smell (not like roses), but my daughter's room doesn't smell like poop because the Diaper Champ does a great job of containing odor.  You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.  It is fantastic!!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"This is amazing! We can toss tons of diapers (abouth 5 days diapers for a new born). And there is NO smell at all. I do recommend the following: Close well each diaper with the velcro, you'll be able to fit more diappers. And occasionally clean the tube where the diaper is toss with baby wipes, then toss the wipe. Somehow when you open the diaper champ to replace teh bag, you smell more wipes than stools!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!  Plus they can get expensive when you're having to change your baby 8 times a day and you have to buy refills for it.  When I first saw the Diaper Champ and read what you needed for it and what it did, there was no question that I wanted it!  It's awesome!  When they say it's odorless, it REALLY is.  The only time you ever smell anything is when you open the lid to empty it and all the dirty diapers are right there.  You never smell anything when it's closed.  Plus, I like the fact that you don't have to buy refill bags for it.  It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.  I recommend this for anyone who is looking for a very convenient and odorless diaper pail!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"This diaper pail has NO ODOR and is the perfect size.  I use normal 10-gallon trash bags from Target.  No complaints at all!  Very easy to use and seriously, you do not smell any poopy diapers!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I own both the Diaper Champ and the &quot;other one&quot;.  I have had the &quot;other one&quot; for two years now and cannot wait to get my toddler out of diapers so I can get rid if it.  I bought the Diaper Champ for my newborn and have had for 2 months and LOVE IT!  Easy to use, easy to clean, and I use tall kitchen garbage bags so emptying it is a breeze!  I wipe it out with Lysol Wipes everytime I change the bag and spray the openings with Lysol once a day and have zero odor problems.  Hint: I also put a dryer sheet at the bottom of the pail in the bag so it gets tossed every time I change the bag and a fresh one gets put in!  Enjoy this product - Wish I had known about it with my first child!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"This is absolutely, by far, the best diaper pail money can buy.  Never do we detect a diaper odor (and my husband has a very sensitive sense of smell and is usually very quick to complain about such things).  For those who say they have a problem with the Diaper Champ getting stuck...the ONLY time this ever happens to us is when the bag is full and needs to be changed.  We love that it uses regular kitchen trash bags, makes it much more economical.  We have not found that we need to worry about frequent emptying or cleaning.  We just leave the Champ to do its job until the mechanism begins to feel like it's getting stuck...then we change the bag.  For us this means about once a week.  Not only is the Champ EASY to use, it's kind of fun.  Before our daughter was born we really worried about whether the diaper pail we chose would be effective enough for us because my husband is so sensitive to smells.  But she's two months old now and we still just can't say enough good things about it.UPDATE:  My daughter is now 9 months old and we STILL love our Diaper Champ.  She's eating solid foods, diapers are smellier, but the Champ is still doing it's job.  We empty once a week and spray with Lysol.  Yes, there is an odor when changing the bag, but we take the bag directly out to the trash, spray Champ with Lysol, insert new bag and close the thing back up.  Everything is just fine after that.  We are so glad we have the Diaper Champ and cannot sing its praises enough."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"At only 3 weeks old, my son goes through about a dozen diapers a day.  We have the diaper champ in his bedroom and it's been great so far.  (We'll see once he switches to solid food and his diapers are a bit more stinky!)  It's so easy to use and you don't have to buy the special bags.  We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.  One recommendation - get a can of Lysol and spray the diaper champ down when you change the bag.  Overall, I love this diaper pail and would buy it again in a hearbeat!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"We've been using the Diaper Champ for about 4 months now, and have had NO problems whatsoever!  The design is absolutely ingenious and the fact that it takes regular trash bags is a definite plus!  We bought a box of Hefty Trash Bags with that odor patch to use in the Champ and we change the bag about 2-3 times a week, and we've have had no problems with smell.  I usually wipe the Champ off with a Clorox Wipe each time I change the bag, but my husband decided to take apart the Champ a few weeks ago to give it a thorough cleaning with some bleach water, and he mentioned that the gaskets were looking worn out.  So, I called Baby Trend (Diaper Champ manufacturer) and they sent me to two new gaskets and two new piston rings (which I didn't even ask for) for FREE!  The customer service rep. even told me to call and request more gaskets and rings when we notice that the new ones start to wear out, usually after about 6 months.  Overall, I am very pleased with our purchase."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did...dirty diapes and soaked diapers.....I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag. No need for deodorizers.I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty...even did while daughter sleep and no noise! I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell! This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"My baby is 1 month old now and we have been using the diaper champ since day 1.  It is ultra convient when you have your hands full with a dirty diaper and a kicking, squirming wiggle worm.  There has been no smell at all, and the champ's generous size allows plenty of diapers, which is important because it seems as though there is no time to do ANYTHING!!!  I would recomend this product to any and all people with babies."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I started off with the Genie but quickly realized that I had to keep buying the special, pricey Genie bags. The Champ is great, takes any appropriate sized plastic bag and contains stinky diaper smells well. A MUST have!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"you can use any ol' bag with this. go to the dollar store and get some of those kitchen bags. they fit it perfectly. you put the diaper in the hold in the top, turn the handle, and pop. byebye poopy diaper! it can hold quite a few. we only need to change the bag once a week. it really does hide the smell. the diaper champ is the best!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"We have been using our Diaper Champ for 4 weeks now (trust me, newborns poopy diapers DO smell) and it has met all our expectations. No odor and easy to use!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"So far so good.  I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.  I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?  Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.  I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I've never even had a problem with it.  There is no odor and I find it very convenient to use garbage bags.  The only thing I do is spray the inside with lysol once in a while.  Even when I change the bag, the only smell is the diapers.  Once they are out, the diaper champ really doesn't have a smell."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"We have purchased three diaper pails prior to this one. This one is a hundred times better. The other ones always had springs that broke or the lid wouldn't stay shut. The Diaper Champ has none of these problems, and it is nice to use regular garbage bags. It was a little more expensive, but well worth the extra money."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"The Diaper Champ was a great invention. No special bags and easy to use one handed. You just put in regular garbage bags (fits like a glove) and empty as you would your regular garbage. NO smells, NO Mess, NO problem. It's a must have!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"This is the only diaper pail we've had and our son is now 2.  We use scented kitchen trash bags ($3-4 for a huge roll at Target) and that seems to improve it's olfactory-blunting performance even more.  For especially messy and stinky diapers, I'll pre-bag the whole bundle in a small scented bag ($1 for 100 at Dollar Tree) that I can rest in the opening of the Champ.This may seem like a lot of bother, but it's not!  I haven't even washed the Diaper Champ out or Lysol'd it in 2 years.  Did I really just admit that?!?  We empty it no more than 2x per week, on average 1x per week.  If there's ever a smell in the nursery, it's from the dipaer's presence pre-Diaper Champ entry.I do wish the Diaper Champ people could find a way to have some button the parent can push to flip the handle while keeping the 1 hand operation.  My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).  Some simple child-proof mechanism would be a Godsend.Even with that said,  the Diaper Champ is a great product and I'd recommend it to anyone!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,Works great - no smells.  LOVE that it uses regular garbage bags. Easy to change and keep clean. Great option instead of the Diaper Genie that requires special bags and is so wasteful since it wraps each diaper in plastic.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"Like other reviewers, I put this diaper pail on my registry because I just didn't want the hassle of having to buy special bags--what happens when you run out in the middle of the night!  I liked the fact that you can use regular bags in this diaper pail... in fact I frequently recycle BabiesRUs bags by using them in the Diaper CHamp.  I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).  You just put the diaper in the hole... flip the lid and the counterweight pushes the diaper down into the bag underneath and its ready for the next diaper--then you flip it back.  The flip handle does get stuck sometimes... but only when it's TIME TO EMPTY THE PAIL!!!!  Some reviewers seem to think the pail should empty itself, but unfortunately nothing on the market will do that for you.  When you change the bag (which is incredibly easy to do) you can just spray the inside with a little lysol and then periodically wipe it out with a sponge and some bleach.  I'd do that much even with the more expensive diaper pails and I'd still have to buy expensive special bags.... You can't expect something that contains poop to smell like a rose or to be germ free without a little work on your part, but with the Diaper Champ you can have a smell-free nursery AND save money by using plain ordinary garbage bags (or recycled plastic bags!)"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"When our daughter was born we bought the diaper genie and it soon became another unused thing in our closet.  I found it so impractical, because no matter what it says it is never truely one hand operable.  And it takes so long to stuff and twist that the baby is neglected on the changing table for a longer period of time.  Also, it didn't hold very many diapers and was a pain to unload.  I would rather just walk each diaper outside!  So when we were pregnant with our son I told my husband that we had to go shopping for a new diaper pail and that's when we found the diaper champ.  I now give this at every baby shower I go to even if the mom-to-be has registered for the diaper genie!  I know she will convert to this one.  I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.  All you do is flip the handle over and you're done.  No need to push the diaper in with your hand (gross!) just let gravity do it's thing.  It is also very easy to unload and install a new bag.  Plus there are no special bags!  Not only a money saver, but no need to worry about running out.  I just use our kitchen trash bags, and they work great."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"Simply put, the Diaper Champ is much easier to use, less expensive, and most importantly, MUCH better at keeping those odors locked away when compared to the Diaper Genie.  Even the smell of my niece's ""soy diapers"" don't seep through this.  I have been thoroughly impressed -- even the nurses at the hospital where I had my baby recommended it."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I agree it's better than the genie.  I own the genie and served us well.  But when I had the chance to use this product at Babies R Us store, I was so impressed.  It's very easy to use, and it seals out the odor as well.  I wanted to get this for our use, but my genie is still in good use.  Too bad, the champ came late, or we should have gotten this instead."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I registered for the Diaper Champ after reading many reviews for several different diaper pails.  This is by far the easiest product to use.  There are no complicated bag systems and no special replacement bags.  I have not had the problem of having any oppressive odors leak out into the room.  The only odor was inside the actual diaper pail itself.  There is no such thing as a completely odorless plastic diaper pail since plastic absorbs odors, but just drop a couple of dryer sheets (Bounce or something similar) into the bottom of the diaper champ (not in the bag) and the odor disappears.  This product is easy to use and the bags aren't hard to change.  I would recommend this to anyone."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,I have no problems with my Diaper Champ.  It's great to be able to use regular diaper bags and I never have any problems with smell.  Definitely recommend
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"We are first time parents but have friends who have young children. We always try to get out of spending the night at their house because the diaper pail in the spare bathroom smells so bad. We took a strangers advice (no one we knew believed in a diaper pail that didn't stink) and we purchased this product. We couldn't be happier. At first we used it for disposable diapers which worked fine, but we were worried about how it was going to hold up when we started using cloth diapers. Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top. We did run in to that once, it means the diaper champ is full and you need to empty it."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I wasn't going to get a diaper disposal system because I knew I did not want a new baby and then worrying about making sure I had the proper garbage bags.  But, I found the Diaper Champ and love it!  It works well and I went to Costco and purchased enough bags to last until the babies in high school for under twenty bucks!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"This is by far the best diaper disposal system we have found. You don't need any special bags - we usually just buy a roll of 35 13-gallon bags from Target for 99 cents. Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ. Your odor problem will be solved.I would recommend this to everyone."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.  It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).  It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.  As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.  For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.  Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.  We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).  It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!Update (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"This is a wonderful product.  One suggestion to the manufacturer--the blue piece that holds the bag in place--perhaps the mouth of this could be made bigger so that an 8 gallon trash bag actually fills up completely before you need to take it out.  Right now, it's only about 1/2 to 2/3 full before we have to remove it."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I did a lot of research before buying a ""diaper system"" (asked friends, read other reviews on amazon, consulted baby product guides, etc.).  There didn't seem to be a consensus on the best one out there.  However, I have been very happy with my Diaper Champ purchase - the stink is contained, the dirty diapers drop in easily and it uses regular kitchen bags (no special bags required like other systems)."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"The best feature is that you can use your own garbage bags.  This makes the investment in a diaper pail a one-time occurance!!  The Diaper Champ works by using a piston-type chute.  You put the diaper in the chute, flip the handle, and the piston slide the diaper down into the bag below.  Nothing fancy...nothing to break!So far, it has worked great.  We change the bags 1-2 times per week.  Yes, it is stinky when you remove the bag, but what do you expect?!  We did put an sticky deodorant in the pail to help.  I agree with previous reviews...you still have to clean the thing!!When comparing to my sister's Diaper Genie, this is much simpler to use and costs much less over its lifetime."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"This has been a fantastic diaper pail for us.  We went through a Diaper Genie with each of our first two children, and this third time, I'm so glad we tried the Diaper Champ.  It has proven to be far better than the Diaper Genies.  Our baby is 7 months old now and eating solids, and the odors have not been a problem.  Not buying special bags has been great.  No twisting; no cutting; no blades to wear out.  Wish we'd used this with our first two."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"Baby Luke can turn a clean diaper to a dirty diaper in 3 seconds flat. The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into ""what diaper smell"" in less time than that. I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery. This is one of the best purchases we made. The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!! There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genieplus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I find this product easy to operate.  With any diaper pail you will have odor, but folding the diapers up and using the sticky tabs on the diapers to keep the diaper folded will help keep odor away.  We bought 2, one for near the crib and one for the main floor.  BRILLIANT idea...didn't have to run up the stairs just to throw the diaper out.  Another helpful idea...put used diaper wipes in the diaper before folding the diaper up...otherwise the wipe will sometimes get caught in the slider and leave poopies on the pail.  How often did we have to empty it?  -  twice/wk when he was 0-3 months...once a wk after that."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,I decided to register for this diaper pail mainly because of the fact that it didn't require special bags.  My baby is now almost 6 weeks old and we are really happy with it.  You can use regular kitchen garbage bags and our nursery doesn't smell at all.  It's very easy to use.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,If you dont want the baby room to smell bad and do not want to worry buying special bags all time. This is the product for you.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,Easy to change bags.Stable when changing bags (others are not!!!) - won't topple over.REGULAR GARBAGE BAGSOne hand use.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,I love this diaper pale and wouldn't dream of trying anything else.  It is great that you can use regular trashbags and not have to buy expensive cartridges.  So far it has done great on containing the odor and I like how easy it is to use.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"Worth every single penny and then some! I orginally registered for the famous """"Diaper Genie"""" but was so thankful that my mother-in-law purchased this one instead after doing some research of her own. No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that! I am even thinking of purchasing one for my upstairs as well. Definitely the best one on the market."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"After reading the reviews and comparing with the diaper genie, I went with the diaper champ; mainly because it didn't require expensive refills. I love that i can use my own trash bags! I change the bags about 2 times/week and have not noticed any smells. I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning). Overall, highly recommend it!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I love the Diaper Champ. I fought with the Diaper Geanie throughout my first son. This is so much easier to use, the three year old has mastered it! Uses your own bags. Don't waste time with others."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I received the Champ at my baby shower, and continue to thank my sister for it. My son can really drop a load, and you would almost never know it once it is in the pail. We do basic maintenance, like cleaning it every so often and spraying Lysol to keep it fresh. We save SOOO much money buying 150 ct 13 gal garbage bags for about $5. My one suggestion would be to change the bags out more ofen then needed, though. It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out. I highly recommend owning one. Good Luck!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,This is an excellent idea having the lid to dispose of diapers.There is no odor and extremely easy to use. Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,It is so easy to use. You never have to change any cartridges and you can use an ordinary garbage bag. I love it and we have never had any smell escape from it.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"This is a great diaper disposal system, but from reading many of the negative reviews I think there are many individuals who did not bother to read the instructions. the bag goes through the hole in the blue retaining ring,  then gets folded over the retaing ring and locked in place, at no point should any of the bag be out side the pale and if the bag is put in place like a regular trash can it will not seal properly and you will probaly get a smell. I can not comment on the few reviews who had a seal falure for I have not had mine long enough."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I read many reviews about diaper disposals and decided on the Diaper Champ and am VERY glad I did!  I had only heard about diaper genie but had never used it until I was visiting my brother who had one.  Now that I have used both, I am even more certain that I like the diaper champ!  With the diaper genie, you have to push the dirty diaper low enough so you can then twist the lid (the whole diaper sausage thing).  I didn't know that until I used it.  YUCK!  Plus what a pain when you have a baby in your hand.  The diaper champ is much easier...put the diaper in the lid and then flip the lid from one side to the other.  Being able to use regular trash bags is what hooked me in but now that I have used it, I'm sold!  There's no smell except for the brief moments when you change the bag.  Just keep a stick-up in the diaper champ, and you'll be fine!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"i love this diaper champ..not only does it save money on bags cause you use whatever brand you want it is bigger so it holds more and i havent had a smell come out of it!  My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!  Another nice thing about it is you can put other items in it besides just diapers, and unlike the diaper genie you dont have to push down and smoush the diaper to get it in.  Wonderful item!!  (as you can tell i have use the diaper genie with my first child)  totally recommend the diaper champ!!!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"This item is great, you can you any bags you want (unlike the diaper Genie)!!!!! It is great for the price!!!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"If you can love a diaper pail that is...  The Diaper Champ is EASY to use (one hand) and very sturdy.  No parts to break unlike the other leading brand.  It does a great job blocking odors and best of all, is compatible with ANY plastic bag.  Here's a tip:  Tie dirty diapers in grocery sacks before depositing into the Diaper Champ.  NO SMELL WHATSOEVER that way!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"For my first born I purchased the Diaper Genie. It worked out well for the first 6 months. As the diaper sizes got larger the harder it was to get the diaper to fit. It would squish out the sides, making a horrible mess! So I purchased the wide mouth size. More $$! The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie. SO in a search for something better than a smelly garbage can in our baby's room, we found the Diaper Champ.The Diaper Champ out performed the Diaper Genie, not once was the diaper too large to fit in the top of the unit and it was cost effective because it uses your standard trash bags!On trash day, we would open the top pull out the old bag, tie it up, throw in a new one, and out to the corner for trash pickup.Ten years and 3 more kids later, this diaper pail is still the Champ in our house!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I received my Diaper Champ at my baby shower for the birth of my first son 11 months ago. I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week! I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags. One thing you might want to be careful of, however...make sure you do not throw loose baby wipes into the Diaper Champ or else the flip mechanism can become jammed and after time will not seal properly due to having to pull out wipes that are stuck. I love my diaper champ so much, I have asked for a second one for my upcoming baby shower for my second son."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I am a second time mom who used the rival Diaper Genie the first time around and let me tell you that there is no comparison. The Diaper Champ is easy to use, easy to change and uses everyday garbage bags instead of the expensive refills. Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell. The Diaper Champ is not perfect, it sometimes feels as if it has filled up too quickly (i.e. maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison. So, I would strongly recommend that you buy the Diaper Champ and not waste your time, money and patience with the other product."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"As a first time mother, I wanted to get the best for my daughter. I shopped around a lot, and asked a lot of questions. While at someone's house, I saw the Diaper Champ. It was one that I hadn't seen very much in the various stores I shopped in. I was immediately impressed by the ease of it, and the convenience of being able to use ANY bag!!!When I bought it, I didn't have a chance to show my husband how to use it -- but no worries!!! It is so simple to figure out how to use! My nephew -- a toddler, knows how to use it (without him being able to open it up!)I've even recommended it to strangers in the baby stores!You'll love it!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"We've now had the Diaper Champ for a little over a year! We love it. It's better for the environment than other disposable diaper systems and it really doesn't smell! I highly recommend it. Drawbacks: it doesn't hold that many diapers at a time. We have 2 in dapers and we changes it 3 times a week or so. It needs to be cleaned pretty often or lots of mold and bacteria start to grow (on the parts you can't see until you take it apart). Lastly part of the fabric/plastic material has ripped on part of it so it is a bit harder to flip back in forth when you  put new dirty diapers in! Overall, this is a great product!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"We put a Diaper Genie on the shower list for the first baby. We used it for 2 years and it was OK but we were fed up with it and I took a chance on the Diaper Champ for #2. After 5 months, we couldn't be happier with Diaper Champ. Here's a short list of the main reasons I'd recommend this against diaper genie:5. Diaper Champ doesn't use expensive refills like the genie. We were going through 2-3 of those $5 refills a month with the genie. On the conservative side, say that was $120 a year in genie refills. With the Diaper Champ, I bought one big box of Glad Kitchen drawstring bags (150 bags) for $15 at the warehouse club. We change the bag 1-2x weekly. The 150 bags will probably last 1 1/2 -2 years, for $15. (The Champ box says you can use plastic grocery bags. Don't. They're way too small and don't hold enough diapers to make it worth the while.)4. The Champ holds a lot more than the genie. Less frequent emptying.3. The genie was a pain to empty and even more work to change refills. Emptying involves tying off the tiny little sausage tube bag, restarting the cut end of the refill. Pain. Changing the refill was just annoying. When the refill runs out, there's not enough bag to tie so you are stuck holding an open end of a dirty diaper bag. I don't need that. And at any change or refill, you have to find another bag to drop the sausage string of dirty diapers into. With the champ, I open the lid, tie off the drawstring bag and that bag goes straight into the garbage can. The new bag goes in as simple as a trash-can liner and close the lid.2. The genie broke after about 15 months. There are 4 little plastic prongs inside that hold the diaper in place while you twist the ring to seal the diaper in the bag. The spring on one broke and it never held the diapers well again after that.1. And my top reason why the diaper champ is champ: It's perfectly easy to use, impossible to use wrong. Whenever we had a babysitter or family member helping while we used the genie, we always took a couple of minutes to show them how to use it. We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in. No, it's not difficult to use or get right once you do it a few times but if you only use it once a month, that dial on top that turns the cutter is just to obvious to turn to ignore and impossible not to turn. Every single time someone got it wrong. So, the Diaper Champ. you drop the diaper in the open hole and flip the handle and it's gone. I can't think of a way anyone could do it wrong and most people who've used it so far, don't need even the simplest hint from us on how to use it."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I chose this product because unlike the Diaper Genie you don't have to buy replacement bags, just pop in a tall kitchen garbage bag which we all have in our homes anyway.  I have twin boys and this product works great.  I recommend spraying it with Lysol and letting it air dry in between bag changes.  This works for me.  It also holds a lot of diapers.  I highly recommend it!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I'm SO glad that we asked the sales associate at Babies R Us for help when picking out a diaper pail.  We were going to get a Diaper Genie like so many folks do, but the associate showed us the Diaper Champ and how easy it was to use. All I have to do is turn the handle and the diaper goes down.  There's no twisting and no special liners to buy.  As far as smell goes, ALL diaper pails will smell if they're not changed often enough.  We don't have a problem with ours smelling as long as we change it every three to four days (which should be done no matter what product you buy).  When I got pregnant with my second child (they are only 18months apart) we bought a second Diaper Champ.  We also just purchased one for my brother-in-law and his wife for their new baby.  Before buying ANY other diaper pail, compare it to this one first.  You'll be amazed at how easy it is to use."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"Love it, love it, love it!  This lives up to the hype.  You cannot smell diapers-unless of course you don't change it or clean out.  You can also use any trash bags you already have around the house, which is why we purchased this particular diaper pail.  It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.  I have recommended this to all new parents!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"After using this for 3 years, I still stunned that other people still use the Diaper Genie.  I've even had other Moms tell me that they can't smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.  If anyone is having trouble, though, try:  a)  wrapping the tabs securely around the diaper; b)  using deodorant trash bags;  and c)  taking dirty diapers straight outside to the trash and using your diaper pail just for wet diapers."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I loved this compared to the genie. It is easier to use and less costly in the long run!!Two thumbs up!!!Now, only if it would spray a freshner on its own. LOL!!!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,I returned the Diaper G**** that I was given but kept this!  It takes ANY garbage bag (no expensive refills) and is wonderful for controlling odor... that's especially important now that our little guy is eating solid food and making more stinky diapers!
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I highly recommend this item.  It is a must!  I registered for the diaper genie and used it for about a week and couldn't stand it.  It broke,the refills are expensive and very hard to install.  Then I got the diaper champ.  What a difference.  Easy to use, just one hand, and no odors.  It uses just your basic tall garbage bags.  So you don't have to go out and buy special bags for it."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I have a 10 year old daughter and an 8 month old son. There was nothing like this when I had my first child and I really looked into the champ v's genie before I brought this and I have to say that I truly LOVE it. I change the bag once a week. My kids have to share a room so if it was smelly I would hear about it. I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new. Aside form that it is so easy to use with one hand, anyone with a wiggly baby will appreciate that. In fact I love it so much I am going to take one all the way to Australia with me for my niece since she can't get them over there. I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"...make sure I tell people about this product. I read the reviews, and at the time, this was the only diaper pail that got any decent reveiws, and now I know why. I bought one for upstairs, and liked it so much I bought one for downstairs. I still have on in my registery hoping someone will get me a third one for my mother in law's house. I just use a standard pull string kitchen trash bag, and use it according to the instructions (in other words if you follow the procedure of opening and sinching the bag before removal then you won't have a problem) and it works great, good design!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I've given this can as a gift a few times now.  Once to a couple who were on their second child, their response was 'how'd we survive through the first baby without that can'.It's easy, ordourless, and clean.  What more could new parents on."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,I have 2 kids in diapers and the diaper champ has been great for us for 2 1/2 years. Easy to use and change. I love that it uses reg bags. :)
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I registered for this after reading all the reviews and I've been nothing but happy with it. I tried my sister's diaper genie and the diaper champ is so much easier to use. The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier. I just leave some in the bottom of the champ then I don't have to go looking for them. I've never noticed a smell, and although I do agree that it is hard to open, you get used to it and it's worth it!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I have had a great experience with this product so far and have been using it for about 2 months.  I get absolutely no odors in the tiny nursery (even when my daughter had very smelly diarrhea), it's easy to use and DOES NOT NEED ANY EXPENSIVE REFILL BAGS (just regular garbage bags) and I would recommend it to anyone."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,The diaper champ is fantastic. You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags. There is absolutely no dirty diaper smell that comes from the Diaper Champ.Absolutely recommend this product.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I love this pail.  You just drop the diaper in the hole, and flip the handle/lid.  Sooooo simple.  It does not smell, and it holds any garbage bags.  With the Diaper Genie, you have to open the lid, shove your arm in the pail, twist 3 times, then wipe off your arm if you know what I mean.  (It also needs special cartridges).  With the Diaper Champ, there is no mess and the diaper is gone in 1 second!  It holds more diapers too.  I definitely recommend it."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I was given the Diaper Geni and after a week of twisting, we bought the Diaper Champ.  This was a great choice.  There is no need to spend extra money on special bags.  We use ordinary supermarket bags.  In order to keep the smell under control, we sprinkle baking soda right at the bottom of the chamber."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"My sister had a Diaper Genie and it always smelled really bad. She constantly complained about it so I opted to try the Diaper Champ. Boy am I glad! It is so easy to use especially since you can use regular trashbags vs. genie refills and the diaper is gone w/ a flip of a handle!! My son is 9 months old and we have NO SMELL PROBLEMS!!! I don't know how some people can complain about smells coming from this thing...it's sealed up like Ft. Knox. You never see the inside of the pail until you empty it. The canister pushes the diaper into the trashbag, thus never allowing odors to escape through the pail. I would have to say the only way you may have an odor problem is if you never empty it!!!!!!!!!!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"This is my second child. With my first, I went through the Diaper Genie and hated it ---her nursery always smelled, even though my husband regularly changed that annoying (and expensive refill, $5.00 for each refill adds up faster than you think!) diaper system, he even took it outside and hosed it down with Clorox bleach and sprayed it regularly with Lysol -- to no avail.We also tried the Neat Diaper disposal system, and it's pretty and works a little better than the Genie, but it still smells up the room.  The Diaper Champ wins hands down, I for one never had an odor problem and I love the fact that it's easy to use and easy to empty, it's also easy to dispose of the diaper with one hand (especially when you're holding and infant and don't want to leave a smelly diaper out of the pail), something I couldn't do with neither the Genie not the Neat pail.I highly recommend it!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I can't say enough good things about the Champ.  For my first son we had the Diaper Genie - but it didn't do the trick. (too $$ and too difficult to handle).For son #2, I read the reviews and decided to give this one a try.  I still love it!  My son (who is now 3+ years old) is finally getting potty trained, but we still use it to hold the ""nightie night dypes""...  We've been using it for 3+ years and it is still going strong.According to the reviews, I was careful to wrap the diapers before putting them in - which we had to do for the Genie anyway... For the REALLY MESSY ones, I flipped up the lid and placed it right in the bag - which was easy to do.My son still loves to pull the handle and say ""bye-bye"" to what he considers the magic trash can.  For me, the only time I experience an odor is when I change the bags. If the odor inside gets too strong, try using Febreeze -- it even works on the plastic!Strongly MOM Approved!!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,My husband and I registered for the Diaper Champ without really knowing much about it.  We picked it because it did not require purchasing refills like the Diaper Genie (which my sister-in-law had and did not really like).  We really like our Diaper Champ because it does not require refills (it uses regular kitchen trash bags)and it keeps out odor completely.  I am recommending this to all my pregnant friends.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"My son is now 18 months old and I have to say that the diaper champ is one of our favorite purchases! We got it when I was pregnant in hopes it would keep our house smelling ok. Well, it does pretty well at that, you still have to change it out everyday, it is poop however!!! But the thing I love most is that I can just use my kroger bags!! With buying diapers and toys, I didn't need something else on my list to buy! What a great invention!!!!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,"I have a two-year-old son and I love the Diaper Champ. We initially bought a Diaper Genie and used it for the first 9 months or so, but we really disliked it. It was difficult to use, loud, and then broke on us. We switched the Diaper Champ and love it. It contains our toddler's odors just fine. We change the bag once a week and when we change a diaper we make sure to roll it up tightly and use the sticky tabs to close it up."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,I bought this after being gievn a diaper genie as a gift. This is much easier to use. You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags. I highly recommend the diaper champ for storing stinky diapers.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,5,This is a great product and a good value for those on a budjet.  Using lysol after changing the bag works well.  I have used my Diaper champ for 3 years and it still works!! I recommed this product to everyone I know.
