Planetwise Flannel Wipes,3,"These flannel wipes are OK, but in my opinion not worth keeping.  I also ordered someImse Vimse Cloth Wipes-Ocean Blue-12 countwhich are larger, had a nicer, softer texture and just seemed higher quality.  I use cloth wipes for hands and faces and have been usingThirsties 6 Pack Fab Wipes, Boyfor about 8 months now and need to replace them because they are starting to get rough and have had stink issues for a while that stripping no longer handles."
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log",3,"I thought keeping a simple handwritten journal would be nice.  But I haven't used this thing at all, and here's why:1.) When you're breastfeeding, it's often nice to have your phone close by so that you can keep yourself entertained.  If you are able to grab *both* your phone and this notebook - and a pen - consistently - and at 3 in the morning - you are more skilled than me.  (I don't nurse in the same place every time.)2.) You're also often so sleep deprived that - at least for me - I'd forget to look at what time we started on a side, or what side we started on.  I'm not perfect with the app I have either, but at least I just have to mindlessly hit a button.3.) I really like the app I have (Baby Connect).  It gives me better data.  For example, it can tell me how long on average feedings have been taking (helpful as we start to think about sleep training).  It can tell me that I nursed him 177 times last month (granted that serves no useful purpose other than a feeling of perverse satisfaction)."
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,3,"Calendar is exactly as described, but I find the look of it to be very cheap.  There are lots of nice stickers to use.  I was just disappointed it looks so cheap."
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",3,My son loves peek a boo at this age of 9 months so I thought this book would be perfect! This book doesn't engage him enough though it seems.  He does however like the cover the most if I make pretend blow-kisses and peekaboo gestures with the hands and show him. He also likes when I fan the hair towards his face.Maybe when he's older he will flip the flaps but right now he just likes the mirror at the end and the front cover. If I flip the book through he just takes the book and shakes it around.
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",3,"The book is cute, and we are huge fans of Lamaze products, however, this one leaves out some family members (no little brother) and can possibly cause hurt feelings. That said, our baby loves to play with the hands, hair and flaps!"
SoftPlay Baby Animals of the World Soft Cloth Book,3,"not bad but not as interesting to my 1-year old as I thought. Mot interactive [texture, etc] but cute anyway"
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,3,"I didn't realize this was a religious product, so I almost returned it.  (Not that I have anything against that, but some of the pages ask for favorite scripture, prayers for the baby, etc.). Wasn't sure that fir with out lifestyle, but the book has all the right ages for memories, so we are keeping it."
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),3,"These are the right color, so I am happy, but the steel on the needle bends easily, and is not as strong as I expected. I am pinning material for a dog bed with these, not diapers."
Wall-stickers Wall Decor Removable Decal Sticker - Giant Cherry Blossom Tree in Wind,3,I am pleased with the design I just wish the actual picture was bigger an putting it together doesn't make sense the numbers aligned with the branches don't make any sense compared to the picture they give you as an instruction -- you have to sort of free hand. I had to start it half way up my wall so it made a difference an could actually be seen -- as far as it hold up I put it up about 2 weeks ago an it had not peeled off at all.
Musical Christmas Nativity Scene Angel with Baby Jesus in a Rustic Barkwood Resin Manger 8&quot; Tall,3,I was so excited to get this nativity.  I have been watching it for months and I finally had an excuse to spend $25.00.  It is beautiful and I am very happy with the look of the item.  I am not so happy about the music box.  The song is WAY too fast and it had to play it through once to even recognize the song.  I don't know if there is a way to slow down a music box; if there is I wish someone would tell me.  I still love the nativity but I am not as excited as I would be if the music had been right.Buyer beware... beautiful nativity; not so great music
Modern House Thomas Train and Friends removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,3,"i hung these over my sond headboard in his thomas themed room, they havent fallen off the wall, applied a week ago so maybe they will be okay but they seemed kinda cheaply made. they do look good and as i said they havent fallen down, if they do i will be sure to revise my review to avoid anyone else making my mistake."
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,3,This was one of my favorite toys-but beware if you buy this I went through 3 of these- and the company no longer exists-so if there is a problem with it-you are out of luck
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,3,"I bought this for my son when he was 4 months old.  He loves all the little animals, but even now at 8 months, he doesn't seem interested in putting them in the fish bowl.  However, he will take them out if they are in there.  My son is very active, so maybe that's contributing to why he doesn't really use the bowl..."
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,3,I purchased this item for my son and its going to be returned the star fish he cant hold on to the fish the only thing he can hold on to was the crab and he liked that because it crinkled.. This is not Our favorite Lamaze toy and it will be going back to the store..
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,3,"I bought this for my son when he was 6mos.  He LOVED it!  What great little teethers each of the sea creatures make.  However, 1.5mos down the road, he totally ignored it.  It was beyond his developmental path.  Cute toy, but I'm not sure it's worth it."
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,3,"I bought this to use on the high chair, but within 2 days my son had the rattle part off the base. Needless to say it never went back on for more than 5 min. BUT he did enjoy it in the car and other places."
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,3,"My son loved this toy.  He enjoyed playing with it in his highchair until he was 10 months old.  At that point he was strong enough to pull the toy from its' base.  He pulled it so hard, he smashed himself in the face with it.  After that upsetting experience, we didn't put it in the base anymore.  He did still play with it as a rattle, but it did not hold his attention as well.  I would like to see this toy redesigned so that it cannot be separated from its' base."
Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,3,"This book is very cute, and despite other comments I found it to be well made. My son is not real interested though but maybe he will later on. I just think that it doesn't have enough pages and interactivity for the price you are paying."
Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,3,"This is a cute, interactive book made out of fabric. It walks you though the night routine (1. Drink your milk, 2. Brush your teeth, 3. Take off your clothes, 4. take a bath, 5. Put on pajamas, 6. Bedtime story, 7. Say a prayer, 8. Lullaby and goodnight) - works well for praying people - unfortunately, I bought it for an agnostic family!"
Baby Monitor - Direct Link Privacy Monitor,3,"Considering how horrible the selection is these days for choosing a quality baby monitor that doesn't transmit to anyone and everyone who may be listening in, intentionally or unintentionally, this seems to be one of the best choices to make.  Your scrambled voice will sound like Donald Duck on a regular analog 46-49 mhz cordless phone or radio scanner, so it's at least a moderate roadblock for the average signal interceptor.  However, why on earth there is no 900 mhz (or higher) digital-spread-spectrum baby monitor on the market is beyond me.  So, this unit is one of the better compromises out there, and at ... on amazon.com, it is amazingly affordable."
HABA Piro Clutching Toy,3,Some of the pictures I saw on line of this toy were much bigger than the actual toy.  I did not notice any measurements in the descriptions and was surprised that it was so small for the price.
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,3,This is a good idea but it takes a lot of pressure for my 7 month old granddaughter to make it vibrate.  I can squeeze one corner to make it vibrate while she chews on the other end.  Otherwise she chews it like a regular teething you.
The First Years Soft Teething Beads,3,"My son has had this teether since he was 3 months old. I thought maybe he's just too young & not interested in it(even though he did have 2 teeth already) He is now 8 months old, and still isn't very interested in this teether. The reason I bought it was because it was in-expensive and easy for him to hold & pick up. He would rather pick up a toy car, or some sort of stuffed toy, which I understand every child is different. My only big complaint - the star bead on the end. It is hard, and pointy. If it catches my son's sore, in-coming teeth the wrong way, he will cry. Other then that, the colors are great, and definitely catch baby's eye. Overall, it's an OK toy for the price."
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,3,"I think slings are some of the most useful items for babies. They make nursing so easy, even while walking around on the street or in a busy store. I love the Sears Library, so I thought the Sears NoJo sling would be great. While I did use it for a long time, and would still recommend it over a front or back carrier (at least for the first few months), I found that this sling was difficult to adjust and my baby seemed to disappear in the first month or so. For small babies I prefer a sling with no railings, and more adjustable. The New Native sling and many others offer this. I would shop around online, there are many better slings than this."
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,3,"I bought this toy for my son when he was able to sit in his stroller.  I to have the Quattro Tour travel system and although I can make it fit by tighting the velcro staps it never stays straight.  I always have to keep spinning the toy around so my son can reach the toys.  Also, two of the pieces already broke off of the bar within two weeks of having it.  I give this product 3 stars because my son did like to play with it but, thats really the only good thing."
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,3,Baby loved this but the only problem is the straps that tie it to the stroller are not big enough for some trays. Due to this my first one came un-sewed and I had to buy another one and the same thing happened again.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,3,"This is a good product to start and very easy to use.  But as baby gets older and begins solid foods, it is not effective as an odor controlling pail.  It is simply a place to put dirty diapers.  My daughter is now 10 months old and we had to remove the Diaper Champ from her nursery because it smells too bad."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,3,"While pregnant with my son I reviewed all the diaper pails and found the diaper champ to be the most reasonable.  I liked the idea of no costly refills and it was only a couple more dollars than the diaper genie.  It was easy to put together, however it is difficult to open and empty.  My son is now 13 months old and the odor is noticeable.  Even the pail itself stinks regardless of how often I scrub it ( I even use scented trash bags).  With dirty diapers you do have to expect some smell, I mean it comes with the territory, however I have to keep an air freshner plugged into the wall to help combat the smell. It worked well for the first few months, but now I end up having to change the bags before they are even half full, which really seems like a waste.  I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,3,"I have not used this item yet for diapers, but as for my first inspection upon receiving this as a gift...I found that every time I moved the handle at the top, the unit wobbled due to the poor design- large at the top with a small base.  I noticed that some online stores sell a new and improved design that has a larger base at the bottom- I purchased the newer model and no longer have the wobble problem."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,3,"I was very happy with the Diaper Champ for a long time. I loved being able to use regular garbage bags, changing the bags was easy, and easy to empty. Very simple to put the diapers in. We did have to replace the sponge ""gaskets"" twice before putting the Diaper Champ to the curb. Once our child was on table foods this diaper pail does not work anymore! Even with cleaning it and letting it air out for a day. It literally made the whole house stink!So out to the curb it went and got something else. There is absolutely no smell w/ the different diaper pail."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,3,"I found this pail to be heavy without anything in it.  I found that it took up too much space.  I find myself using a regular small garbage pail and I don't smell any odors (and all of my windows are closed).  dislike the mechanism for opening this pail, when I opened this pail for the first time, I broke two of my nails, I tried opening again and it was still hard on the fingers and nails. My son is only two months and perhaps I need a diaper pail later on, but for right now, I am going to use a regular garbage pail."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,3,"I love the diaper champ for how many diapers it holds and the fact you don't have to buy special bags for it, but it doesn not keep in the odors. I feel like I have to change the bag more often so I don't know how much I'm really saving by not buying the special bags that a diaper genie requires. I spray the pail after every use and have cleaned it out with bleach and it still smells. Great idea but it just doesn't work. I haven't gone back to the diaper genie yet...is there anything else out there that works?"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,3,"I have a two month old.  I've tried both the Diaper Champ and the Diaper Genie for two months now.Bottom line:If cost is important to you...get the Diaper ChampIf smell is important to you...get the Diaper GenieThe design of the Diaper Champ does not prevent smell as well as the Diaper Genie PERIOD.If you see a review here that touts that the Diaper Champ doesn't smell, then laugh at them.  They probably have a dog and think that it and their house don't smell because of the dog either.YES, the Diaper Genie costs more over the life because of their bags.  SO WHAT."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,3,"After the first 6 months I would have been rating this diaper pail top of the heap.  Certainly not having to buy special bags is a HUGE advantage... and the hole is larger that the genie so you don't have to worry about the &quot;squish&quot; factor as much.The problem, and the reason others had a smell problem is that this pail has large foam washers and a foam pad in the top section that get rank after time.  Luckily we just called the company and they sent new ones and the smell went when they did, but it was a bit of a pain.  I still think it was worth it to buy this one!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,3,"I have used my Diaper Champ for a little over a year.  I was taken in by the fact that I could use grocery bags instead of continually purchasing liner refills.  The Champ worked great for only a small while.  As your children grow, the Champ will be very little help in controlling odor, which is the sole reason I purchased a diaper pail instead of a garbage can.  I change the pail every two days, sometimes every day due to the odors it fails to control.  I have begun to individually wrap up each smelly diaper before putting it into the diaper pail.  Otherwise, my son's room would constantly smell.  I am reluctant to purchase a new diaper pail, but the hassle with this one is pushing me to it.  Consider the Diaper Dekor or Neat Disposal System instead.  I've read great reviews on both."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,3,"This contains the smell and it uses regular bags which makes it the best product in its category.  However, I never use it.  It's so much easier just to throw the soiled diaper in a regular garbage bag and take the trash out often.  We take ours out daily - this product tends to make you lazy and by the time you fill it - YUCK!Save your money and just throw your diapers in the trash."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,3,"We bought this because we needed a first floor diaper pail.  And the Diaper Genie was a bit hard to use, so we tried this one.  While this is very easy to use (one-handed), after 36-48 hours, it smells really bad!!  So we have to change the bag in it very frequently.  Oh well, I'd still recommend it.  You just may have to buy stock in air fresheners as well.  And we even bag our smelly diapers before putting them in."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,3,"We are cloth diaper users and were attracked to the diaper champ because it said it could be used for cloth diapers and it keeps the smell in unlike other diaper pails. We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes. Some of our diaper covers also got stuck in the mechanism and I had to take it apart with a screwdriver to avoid ripping the cover. Mine is now in a closet and I'm using a regular garbage pail. If you are planning to use cloth, this is not the pail for you.If your are using disposables, I think this pail would be great since you can wad them up into a tight ball. It doesn't stink except when you open it to change the liner and it takes regular bags."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,3,"Great size, we only change each week but after 5 months the smell started to seep through and the nursery after 8 months is smelling too much of diapers now, despite airfreshners etc.  If my baby used this as a bedroom, he sleeps with us I would have replaced this sooner !!  I even washed it all our in bleach but the seals must have gone as its just getting worse.  I like the size though and love the fact you just put the diaper in dirty and swing the top over.  One problem with this is when it gets full the diapers get stuck - thats not very pleasent too.Going to BabyRUs this morning as after 8 months I decided today is the day its ready totally for a new one."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,3,"We received the Diaper Champ as a shower gift.  It worked great for the 1st 5 months.  As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,3,"This is a great product until your little one starts to play with the handle.  Because the flip-flop handle comes in contact with the dirty diapers when the bag gets full, curious fingers can pick up some nasty germs &amp; even poop if a diaper isn't wrapped up into itself (The Grandmas seem to have trouble with that).I have been very happy with the simplicity of the Champ &amp; using regular garbage bags until now.  However, my 14 month old loves to play with it &amp; flip the handle over. I just cringe when I think about what he gets on his hands.Also, the padding in the lid that keeps odor under control seems to have worn out after 1 year.  It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too. YUCK!Overall, I would recommend the Champ for infants because it's VERY easy &amp; you can use 1 hand, but now that I have a toddler I'm looking for a pail with a locking lid."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,3,"The Diperchamp is easy to use, as other people have said. We bought it with our first child, but stopped using it before she turned one. It does not keep the smell in and with only one stinky diper in there my daughter's entire room would smell the moment you walked in.I really loved the diperchamp when she was a newborn and her dipers did not smell. Now that we are pregnant with our second child I am not planning on using it again because we did not use it for very long."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,3,"It is so much easier to use than the Diaper Genie (my sister has that) but it does have some problems.  We've used it for a year now, and it never started to smell until the diapers did.  It generally only smells when it's really full or you're emptying it out.  I wouldn't say the smell is such a problem though.  Whenever I empty out the bag (love the fact you can use regular trash bags) I would wipe out the inside and saturate it with Lycol for disinfecting.  The only reason why I am going to have to buy the Diaper Genie now is that my 1 year old loves to put items (sippy cups, toys, etc.) into the hole in the top and flip the handle.  I didn't realize he could do this until one day when a sippy cup went missing, and after EXTENSIVE searching I found it inside the diaper pail!  Since then, I have caught him many times trying to do the same thing.  Over all, it's a good product.  I think if you smell strong odors coming from the Diaper Champ, it's time to clean and empty it!"
