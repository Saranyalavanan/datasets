"SoftPlay Cloth Book, Love",1,This book is boring. Nothing to stimulate my granddaughter. It is a waste of money. I would not recommend it
Hunnt&reg; Falling Flowers and Birds Kids Nursery Home Decor Vinyl Mural Art Wall Paper Stickers,1,The reason:Small sizeHard to apply on the wall because most part of flower only in one pieceYou will know how waste money it is when second day morning you see all the flowers fell on the floor in a roll.
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),1,"The steel part is not strong at all, unlike the old diaper pins, which I still have.  Very hard to work it through a thicker fabric.  Would not recommend."
Super Mario Game Nintendo Wall Sticker and Decal,1,These do not stick to the wall. They start to peel as soon as you stick them to the wall.
New Style Trailing Cherry Blossom Tree Decal Removable Vinyl Kids Wall Decal Wall Sticker Peel and Stick,1,Was so excited to get this product for my baby girls bedroom!  When I got it the back is NOT STICKY at all!  Every time I walked into the bedroom I was picking up pieces off of the floor!  Very very frustrating!  Ended up having to super glue it to the wall...very disappointing.  I wouldn't waste the time or money on it.
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,1,"Great idea, but the toy IS NOT durable.  After returning one toy for not working, another one has broken.  What a disappointment!!  And the customer service is non-existant and when it is, they are rude!!!! Someone let me know when the class-action lawsuit will occur."
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,1,"I bought this toy for an addition to my son's exerciser. However, it would not stick (to anything)!! I tried everything to make it stick. It was very frustrating."
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,1,"Based on articles on the dangers of PVC plastic books, this book was tested and found to contain chemicals that are highly toxic for babies and toddlers. This materials have already been banned from children's toys in Europe.In order to read the many articles online that specifically name this book as having been found to contain chemicals that are dangerously toxic for children, google ""toxic bath books"" or the title of the book with the word ""toxic.""This book's concept is wonderful, but those who love children should share photos in another kind of album or book."
Fisher Price - Baby Bowling,1,I'm really disappointed with this toy.  It never kept my daughter's attention.
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,1,"This teether is ridiculous. It's huge, it's hard to clamp down on, and my daughter had no idea what was going on when it started vibrating in her mouth.It's just too big, awkward, and hard to push down on. Not worth the money, in my opinion."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,1,"My four month old started teething around two months, he has pretty impressive motor skills when it comes to using his hands but this teether is huge and you really have to apply quite a bit of pressure for it to vibrate. My other son who is two and also teething shows absolutely no intrest in this at all. Maybe in a couple more months...."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,1,"The older one of these lasted us several years for my special needs daughter who likes the vibration. This one lasted 3 months before the battery died. Folks, you need to work on battery life or just go back to the old style teether!"
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,1,This product sucks. My little boy LOVES to chew on things while he's teething - and he bites down hard. He was never able to bite hard enough to get this dumb thing to vibrate. Very disappointing.
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,1,"I bought this for my 8 week old daughter, we are planning a trip to Texas and did not want to take the heavy stroller...I tried her in the sling,she got very hot and because of that she got heat rash all over her face and neck (she was only in the sling for about 10 minutes)!!!! I did not like all the padding, it makes it to bulky! On top of all that it gave me a back ache!!If you are serious about a sling I would choose the Maya, it is a thinner material, and is not bulky at all. That is what I ended up buying, and my daughter loves it and so do I."
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,1,"I thought this would be an excellent item to have. I was wrong! This is the most cumbersome thing I own and my son sweats like crazy in it. There's no support for the baby's neck or back, and I always feel like he's about to fall out of it. Unless you've got really strong shoulders or a feather-weight infant, you might want to skip the infant carrier thing completely. Save yourself time and money on this - I wouldn't buy it again!!"
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,1,"I think the idea behind the sling is great but it is not for every baby.  Everytime our son is put in this he crys or screams.  He is an easy going fellow but he hasn't liked being held to closely.  He wants his freedom and this doesn't give much freedom to a newborn.  Also, the &quot;training&quot; video is more of a promotional advertisement.  I had to go to the web site to get more information about how to use it."
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,1,This is a great product but it is just too big for me. If you are 5'5&quot; inch. and below please do not get this cause it will look like a sack on you.  My baby was terrified and looked uncomfortable in it. She cried everytime I put her inside. Practice makes perfect but eventually my baby &amp; I got tired of using this.
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,1,"Every time I hear a parent say that they tried a sling, but baby hated it, or it was a pain, or they just ended up not using it, this was the sling they tried.  People who love their slings used a Maya Wrap, Over the Shoulder Baby Holder, or New Native sling.  All of which come in great fabric choices and are easy to use."
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,1,"My neighbor had the Nojo and liked it so I was going to get one too. I tried hers, but I couldn't get it tight enough so my baby hung down too low which didn't seem safe and hurt my back. I thought I could order a different size, but found it only comes in one size. I then read all the reviews here and followed someone's advice and ordered a from babymoon slings. It fit me better (I'm petite) and was a lot easier to use (and prettier!). I think it makes a big difference to get a sling that's not bulky and comes in sizes - I don't get why they use so much padding in the nojo, it makes it really hard to use with a newborn compared to other slings."
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,1,"I bought this babysling after reading about it in Dr. Sears' book.  My daughter was 2 months old and fussy!  Nothing seemed to work.  I was desperate!  Since the babysling was adjustable I thought it would fit all body types...not!  I am of average height but on the slimmer side.  It gave me alot of shoulder and back pain.  I rate this a one star because I found one use for it...I use it tied around my torso to carry my daughter on my back with the slight support of my hands. Back carrying is a bit tricky so don't try it alone!  I think baby slings are great but not this one is not for me.  If you are slimmer than average, try the New Native baby carrier.  It's portable and comes in different sizes."
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,1,"This is a horrible product - because the base of the bar is round, it doesn't attach properly to a stroller, and it keeps sliding forward or back, thus losing all the snacks in the cup.  They need to redesign it with a flat base.  There is one company that has one with the flat base - it's made by Kids11, Inc -and my daughter LOVES IT!  Don't waste your money on this one - you, and your little one will just be frustrated!"
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,1,"This toy was a waste of my money.  It did not fit on my stroller without some modification and even then, it didn't stay put.  It would not stay upright when my daughter played with it.  And it had a removable piece in it.  Needless to say, it was not a piece my daughter at the time knew how to put in and out.  And on top of that, she decided that she'd rather play with the removable plastic piece than the toy itself!  Also, my stroller would not fold up with this on (oh yea, my stroller is a name brand stroller too).  I would have to remove it everytime i folded it up.  Needless to say, I did that about twice and then tossed the toy in the trash."
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,1,This toy is very cute and I personally love Sassy products but I found this to be a hazard as well as a waste.  First of all the butterfly hits my children in the face and has hurt their mouth as well not to mention it does not fit properly on a stroller.
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,1,"Once my daughter started teething, the paint started coming off &amp; it was only when we found some on her lip that we realized.  We have not used it since &amp; had only been using the bar for a couple of months.I worry about such things as 'paint eating' &amp; consider the possible risks to be too concerning to rate this product any higher than 1*.Best wishes."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,1,"My husband and I selected the Diaper ""Champ"" mainly because you can use ordinary trash bags and not be roped into buying the specialty refill bags, and it was moderately priced (a little less than the Diaper Dekor). It also seemed that the reviews of this product were generally more positive...The positives are:1. You can use any trash bag2. Easy to use and refillThe negatives are:1. The bag doesn't seal around the dirty diapers, so when it comes time to refill the bag, it's just like opening a regular trash can. Smells like the Champ is trying to knock YOU out with odor!2. The plastic seems to smell, ie. You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ. That ""side"" of the plastic dumper-thingie is in contact with the air inside the dirty diaper changer, so when you flip it over the next time to dispose of another diaper, you smell the last 8 diapers you put in there...pretty gross.3. The ""odor seal"" (some soft material) really seems to retain odor. It cannot be washed or replaced, so after a while, the Diaper ""Champ"" smells even when freshly washed and deodorized (I'm talking about hosing down outside and scrubbing with Clorox cleanser!). Super-frustrating! This is my primary complaint.Okay, so some things are a given as far as disposal systems go (ie. *some* odor, must empty frequently, must wash and disinfect occasionally), but still I think this product leaves much to be desired.We're going to try another disposal system."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,1,"I have had a diaper genie for almost 4 years since my first son was born and I have been using it with my second as well.  I thought I'd try the champ to save $ on the genie refills.  Well it is not a $ saver because it does not hold the odor inside so I was constantly changing the trash bags.  The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.  The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.  I suppose you could use it as a regular trash can in your child's room-they wouldn't be able to get into it!  Don't waste your $ to ""save"" $!  Buy the genie-your nose will thank you!!  Also, if you don't keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it! YUCK!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,1,"We loved this pail at first. The mechanism seemed ingenius, and we appreciated that it took regular bags. But once our daughter started to stand up, that big white handle was irresistable to her, and before we even realized it, she started flipping it. That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers. Worse yet, they can slam a finger then hurt it seriously in their attempts to get it free by pushing the handle the wrong way. It's really pretty scary.You'll notice that the positive reviews here generally say ""I've been using this for two months, and it's great!"" But once you have older babies, I'd retire it pronto."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,1,"Bad construction is my main issue. My husband assembled it and when changing the bag, you're supposed to open up the top head part which tilts back.  There's a little plastic tab that's suppused to slide in as your opening the top, but instead it get's cought so it allows the top to open up only partially. It may just be one defective item that somehow passed the quality control inspection, but I've given up on diaper pails in general.  Talking to 1st time parents, I found out that almost everyone gets one, but almost everyone stops using them very quickly."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,1,"Diaper catches and jams in the well and that is particularly nasty when the diaper is dirty.  Also, it is impossible to get it 100% clean after such a jam, which causes the oder to persist.  I have given up and am now throwing my Diaper Champ away and getting something new."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,1,"After 2 and half years I still can't get the smell out. Its been sitting outside airing out for 3 months now, I think thats where I'm leaving it too. I love the concept of a diaper champ, but somebody do something about the smell, please."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,1,"This is the worst diaper pail ever!  It was great for the first couple weeks, but then it began to smell.  I cleaned the inside and outside with 409 again and again, but the smell would return with the first diaper I put in.  Then to make matters worse my 16 month old figured out it was fun to put toys in the hole where you put the diapers and try to flip it the way I did with his dirty diapers.  I had a Diaper Genie that broke and was hopeful that this less complicated diaper disposal system would work as well, but it does not!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,1,Can't get the smell of rank diapers out of the top(cover) of the Diaper Champ. Any better models out there?
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,1,"Overrated, odor is bad. I changed to Gallon zip-locs, you can stuff a few diapers in a gallon zip loc and discard.  If you don't want the diaper smell don't get this."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,1,My 8 year old yellow lab was able to get the top of the diaper champ off and get his head stuck in the canistar.  No one was home and he suffocated.  This could just as easily have happend to a small child.  There is no warning in the literature to prevent this type of horrible tragedy .
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,1,"I believed the reviews of this product, and bought it when my baby was an infant.  It worked very well while I was still breastfeeding, but once we started solid food, the smell was pretty bad.  Each morning when we went into his room, the whole place smelled like diapers.  Still, I resisted the diaper genie, because I didn't want to spend the money on the refills.  However, by 10 months, we had enough, and finally bought a diaper genie.  What a difference!!  The only time smell escapes is when we empty it.  To me, it is worth the price of refills not to have to put up with the smell.  If it is not worth it to you, just buy a regular garbage can--it will work just as well as the &quot;champ&quot;."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,1,"We got the Diaper Champ because we thought it was smart to use regular garbage bags and not pay for the diaper Genie refills. BIG MISTAKE! This product does not keep odor in, and when you open it up to put in a new bag in, its all over. My daughter's room stinks because of this product and we are in the process of trying to find a REAL odorless diaper pail."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,1,"I got this pail because I felt it was good that it doesn't require you to buy """"their"""" garbage bags.  But at the end I still didn't use it and just use a regular pail.  Now it's sitting in my basement.  The reason I didn't use it is because it is hard to open up the can to replace the bag and when you are actually cleaning a baby especially when it's #2 it is messy at times where you would probably get it in the pail before you flip the handle to dispose of it.  Well then you  now need to clean the pail as well as the baby.  You don't need more work with a child."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,1,"Worst diaper pale ever!!  I've had mine for 2 years now and I am throwing it away as soon as my second Decor arrives.  No matter how many times I clean the ""Chump"" it still stinks.  The diapers and wipes get caught in the drop hole and stuck wet wipes make it stink even worse.  Forget scented trash bags, they won't cure the smell of the ""Chump"".  Also, watch out when changing the bag, you may lose a finger if the lid unexpectedly slams shut on you when changing it.  Forget this pale and go for the Decor."
