A Tale of Baby's Days with Peter Rabbit,4,"Lovely book, it's bound tightly so you may not be able to add alot of photos/cards aside from the designated spaces in the book. Shop around before you purchase, as it is currently listed at Barnes & Noble for 29.95!"
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log",4,This has been an easy way for my nanny to record all the key events that happen with my baby when I'm not at home.  Would highly recommend it to someone who wants to stay informed of what your baby is up to while you're not home.The only reason this isn't a 5 is because I think there could have been some more standarad pre-printed options.I plan on ordering another one when we run out of pages in this journal.
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log",4,"I love this journal and our nanny uses it everyday to track on our daughter's sleep, eating and other activities. The layout and design make it very easy to fill in quickly with a comments column to add in details (i.e. we ask the nanny to specify what food she had for lunch, amount of milk she took, specifics of play time--tummy time, walk to park, etc.) I love knowing the details of my baby's day, and I also use it to track weekly on overall schedule patterns and changes (i.e. baby's nap time has moved naturally as she gets older).My only complaint is that there is no real space to communicate back to the nanny, as I sometimes want to reply to the nanny's comments and/or leave her notes about the previous night (i.e. Baby didn't sleep well or baby has rash, etc) or other instructions (Please use sun screen on the baby - it's hot out today) that I often forget to tell her in the rush of the morning. I just stick in post-its now for my notes. All in all, I highly recommend this baby tracker."
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log",4,"I originally just gave the nanny a pad of paper to write down this information for my little one. She would take him to the park and leave the pad behind - I was getting incomplete/inaccurate information when she wohld get home at the end of the day and try to remember naps/feedings/diaper changes. I wanted something she could take with her and also a way to better control how she reported information. This was the perfect solution! Now I'm getting all the information I wanted. There is a very helpful example of how to fill it out. It also has a pouch for additional documents and a section up front for emergency contact info. Each page goes from 7 - 6. This works for me because the nanny starts at 7am and ends before 6pm. I use an app on my phone for tracking when I'm with the baby. I transfer the info from this notebook to my phone. My only complaint: the space is pretty small - they provide useful shorthand, but it's a little difficult to fit some of the info in the space provided. Also, some of the other reviews complain about the 7 - 6 time format. This isn't a real problem for me, but I suppose if you wanted to track an entire day, you would have to use two pages - not too big of a deal. 7am - 6pm is pretty much perfect for daycare/nanny/caregiver situation."
Nature's Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar,4,"I bought this calender for myself for my second son. It is very colorful and has room on each page to write height, weight, and what baby likes to do. There is also room on each page for a photo to be placed. The calender date boxes have room for a sticker and some fine writing. My only complaint is that it does not have as many stickers as I would like, but I just put asterisks before whatever special event happened that day. I bought one for a friend as she found it very useful as well."
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,4,I completed a calendar for my son's first year and really enjoyed tracking all of his milestones and special moments - so much so that I wanted to continue in the second year since he's still doing amazing and fun things every day.  I really like the simple layout of the calendar and while it might not have all the questions and milestone stickers you want - at least it's something to keep recording all those special moments!
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",4,"One of baby's first and favorite books, and it is washable! I gave 1 less star than perfect because I'd like to see some diversity in the people - not just your typical white family ;)"
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",4,The book is colorful and is perfect for 6months and older. The only thing I didn't like was the strong smell of the dyes and/or material. I dunked the pages in detergent. Then let the book dry overnight.
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,4,"We wanted to get another book like the Big Birds Friends softplay book, and we only found the two Elmo books. This one is fun, but the Big Bird book has more variety and is more creative."
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,4,This is a cute little peek-a-boo story book.  It's soft.  It's safe.  And it is easy for baby to handle.
"SoftPlay 4 Pack Block Book, Sweet Sesame",4,"I have teething babies and these were great for entertaining the, and letting them chew and droll all over the, without worrying about ruining them. They were great for setting them off to their side to encourage rolling over and crawling. Great Christmas gift for the younger baby and didn't break the bank."
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,4,Bought as a gift for my daughter in law. She loved it. Simple but a place to put important memories down. I loved the verses at bottom of pages.
Jellycat Elephant and Mouse Book,4,The book is just a few pages long with a few words to each page.  Just short enough to keep the attention of my 6 month old son.  We have the Elephant as well so when he's older it will be neat to see the realization of the association between the stuffed toy and the book character
Beautiful Girl and Black Flower Removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,4,"It is nice and looks great on my wall. It was just a bit smaller than what I thought, but that was my fault and not taking the measurements."
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),4,We bought the pins as my 6 year old Autistic son was able to open or break open normal safety pins we needed to use for his night time clothes.  These new pins are significantly more sturdy and he hasn't learned how to open them and only once has he broken one open.  I seem to recall that their shipping price was more than a bit on the high side of reasonable though given the size of the package...
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),4,"Like = sharp ends that pierce through my diapers easier.  Dislike = the sides bend which is a pain.  That said, I am pushing them through older velcro tabs because the velcro on my diapers doesn't work anymore."
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),4,Diaper pins are hard to find locally!  This is a useful item to have - no matter the purpose...
Semanario (7) Little Girls 14k Gold Overlay Bangle Bracelets for Your Little Princess Sizes 1 - 4 (Size 2 - ages 9-24 Months),4,. I am pleased with product. I love the bangles however they are a bit small. Had to slid them on with lotion. I like a snug fitting bangle but whew these were tough to get on!! If my hand was a hair bigger they wouldn't have fit. They are on to stay. I have small hands also. I got the size for large kid small adult and they fit wrist but tough over the hand. Overall satisfied with product and fast shipping!
IKEA DUKTIG 15-piece breakfast set,4,This was for my 2 yr. old great granddaughter and she has a lot of fun playing with the set and pretend cooking.
"IKEA KLADD PRICKAR Bib, blue, red",4,I like those bibs. they are very useful. easy to wash and dry. the price is awesome. My friends also like them very much.
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",4,"I used a tracker with my first son - but I didn't so much need to with my second.  This tracker though, is laid out very well and keeps things pretty organized.  My only complaint is that it is not a full year tracker - I did the whole first year with my first son which is nice to refer back to.  I would recommend this book, but if you're interested in tracking the whole first year you will need to buy 3 (they run 4 months long)."
Edu-Petit Teddy Bobo's Big Learning Book Developmental Toy,4,"I bought this for my 17 month old son as a form of quiet, in-crib entertainment when he wakes up at 5am. So far, he likes it a lot... even got an ""ooooooh"" when I first handed it to him."
Modern House Trailing Cherry Blossom Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,4,well its not as big as it looks in the picture but it is awfully cute looking. actually is only about one foot tall.
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,4,"Our whole family loved the Mozart music blocks. I even bought another &quot;disk&quot; of music. Unfortunately, it was a constant challenge to keep the kids from destroying the delicate &quot;chip&quot; that was easily accessible. Finally it broke and I felt it was too expensive to replace. I feel that a toy at this price should be more durable. My suggestion would be to hide the &quot;plug in chip&quot; so that the kids aren't attracted to it. We have a 3-year old and a one-year old. The toy lasted about 6 months."
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,4,"This is an interesting and educational toy.  I got it for my 2 year old, and while she loved mixing up the blocks, she also loved pulling out the cartridge and couldn't put it back in.  That means I had to go put the cartridge back every 5 minutes.  If the cartridge were placed on the side or back, I don't think the littler ones would be so inclined to pull it...out of sight out of mind."
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,4,I bought this 18 months ago for my 6 year old and 2 year old.  They both loved it.  I bought additional cartridges then it stopped working.  We replaced the batteries twice and it still does not work.  It was expensive for a toy that did not last very long.
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,4,"We received this as a present for our 6 month old.  I don't really think she's old enough to put the individual toys in the fishbowl, but she sure loves playing with them!  I've noticed that she likes &quot;crinkly&quot; toys, so she loves the crab.  So far, it has kept her very entertained.  I really like Lamaze products so far"
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,4,"I bought this toy for my baby and for friends' babies as well. The babies really love the faces on the toys and get a kick out of the different sounds each one makes. They enjoy looking at them through the clear plastic and taking them out and putting them back in over and over. Most kids seem fascinated by ocean creatures anyway, so I think it's bound to be a guaranteed &quot;hit&quot; for any child. My 2 1/2 year old still loves to play with the crab!"
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,4,"I've owned this set for several years.  My 4 granddaughters love to play with the cars.  Stacking, nesting, playing with the few moving parts.  It is one of their favorite toys when they come over.  And it is definitely one of mine - Lots of play value that stores very well.  They have learned colors, and numbers with these also."
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,4,"My son has played with these from 6 months old, and still likes them occasionally (18 months now).  The small car is nice for babies to shake.  They don't do much, but they are cute."
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,4,"I bought these for my 1 1/2 year old, and he loves them (and so does his 5-year old brother). They both stack the cars, hide them and ""vrroomm"" them. It is great to find a toy that doesn't need batteries or require an engineering degree to put together!Highly recommended."
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,4,"I bought the cars because they were easy to store, plus they were cars.  What I have found is that I can actually use then in many places since there is more than one vehicle.  Mostly they are easy to pack for a trip."
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,4,"I got this toy for my daughter when she was very little.  She really hasn't been interested until recently.  Now she loves to put little people inside the cars and look at them through the top.  She lets objects play hide-and-seek under the cars but she really doesn't stack them or nest them very much.  I think they are worth the money because they were fairly cheap but she hasn't really used them for the intended purpose.  I don't think I would buy them again but I certainly wouldn't take them back if they were given to me. I think my daughter will use them in different ways with other toys, in the tub or pool or even outside as she grows.  They are extremely durable."
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,4,My son got this for Christmas and he loves all the cars.  His favorite is the fire truck.  He plays with it for a while.
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,4,"i bought this beautie at k mart for 5 bucks. other that the suction cup not really working out well, my 3 month old loves it. hell, my husband and i also enjoy playing with it. it has a variey of colours and shapes that help stimulate the mind. you cant lose."
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",4,This was given as a gift for my great grandson and they seemed very satisfied with it.  I haven't talked to them to see how he responded to it.
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",4,"Got this for a plane ride 3 months ago. The snaps are hard to snap and he gets frustrated. Most pieces are attached to the book which is nice, he can't lose them. He flips thru it but that is about it. Maybe when we travel again he will find it more interesting. We keep it for trips only so it will be ""new"" each time. He has seen it up on the shelf and asks for it but when we give it to him he is done flipping thru in a few minutes and it is left on the floor for other books."
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",4,"My 2 yr+ old grand daughter liked this book a lot.  She did have a hard time with some the buttons or snaps.  They were sewn pretty tight to the backing and was kind of hard to get her fingers under to be able to button or snap.  Overall, she did enjoy each activity."
Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,4,"I ordered this book for the up-coming birthday of a grandson. It really is cute and an excellent quality. It comes with a small stuffed bear that you can remove from the book. Each page of the book has a different night-time activity for the bear to do such as have a glass of milk, brush his teeth etc. I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting because even though it is a quality toy I'm not sure that Liam will use it enough to make it worth the price I paid.  The Pockets of Learning toys all seem to be very high quality if somewhat pricy."
Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,4,"Both of my boys liked playing with this book.  They also liked to take the bear out and play with him.  The pajamas are a little hard to put on, but they didn't seem to care much.  My youngest actually has slept with the little bear!"
Big and Small Chime Ball by Sassy,4,My daughter is 4 months old and she really loves this ball as its very easy for her to hold - a skill she's just learned.
Infant Stim-mobile,4,"We found this at a garage sale and I read about it and it seemed really interesting so I bought it. This is for the first few months of a baby's life and should not move much, contrary to what the first poster said, because you want stimulation but you don't want to over-stimulate a baby. However, we did notice that sometiems our baby does like the mobile to move and it is summer here but the air conditioner blowing air around the room should be enough movement. When it's not moving, we can just put a small fan on its lowest setting about 6 feet from the crib and the small wiggling was enough movement to keep her stimulated but not so much movement that she can't keep track of the object (babies this young are not good at tracking so you don't want a lot of motion), but still we only do this once in a while, not at all times.One of the best things about this mobile is that our baby only wakes us up at night to feed. If she wakes herself up she will sit and stare at it for a long time and be happy since we have a small nightlight in the room. Any time we put her in the crib we can see her staring at the simple shapes. Shown in the picture on the product page is the detailed shapes, you flip the cardboard from the simple to the detailed shapes when they are about 2 months old, then remove this mobile for a more 'traditional' one with movement and objects the baby can grab at about 4 months. This is a somewhat delicate mobile since it uses air currents to move, so you need to keep it safe from a grabbing/eating baby.Also, one nice feature is that ours came with a travel pack, or at least that's how I'm using it. Besides the crib mount, there is an 8 inch circular plastic ring with fishing wire for hanging the mobile. You can hang it anywhere with a string, either taping string to the ceiling or tying it to any overhang. It also came with a cardboard carrying case thing which is very thin and easy to take with you on a trip.For those with a math/science background, it's really interesting to note that first side of the cards have objects with very low spatial frequency. The 'detailed' sides are actually the same patterns, but with a moderately higher spatial frequency. After 4 months, you use standard mobiles, which have very high spatial frequencies, as well as colors and things the baby can grab to improve hand-eye coordination. Basically, you start showing the child very low frequency objects that are easy to observe and track, then gradually move up until they can use the high frequency information.Now, I want to explain why I did not give this item 5 stars even though it's an amazing product. Before my baby was a month old, I noticed that she was already able to detect some colors and this stim-mobile is only black and white. This is from 1990, so I guess over the last 20 years they have refined the product so that the simple side has some red (first color a baby sees) and other simple colors, while the reverse side has more vivid colors, but uses the same idea of going from low spatial frequencies to higher spatial frequencies. I ordered the newest version but still kept this around for changing table and pack n play entertainment since she loves it. If I had not known about the improved version, I would have given it 5 stars, but there is something better available so I highly recommend getting the updated version for every newborn."
Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,4,"I have to say, the first time we played with this I thought it was going to be a dud and I was thinking I would send it back.  It's very simple and not much interaction to it.  But it turns out my 2 year old daughter loves it.  She gets a kick out of it and it's all she needs in a toy.(This is the Comfy PC and not the Elmo toy.)"
Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,4,"My daughter loves this product! It covers her 2 favorite things the PC and the phone! Whenever I am on the computer she is always on my lap trying to push whatever keys she can, but with this I can put her in her highchair and put her in front of the PC and she will entertain herself for at least an hour!  She espicially loves the phone aspect on the side and what I love is there is no cord to worry about. I would definitely reccommend this to anyone with a toddler, I started using this with my daughter when she was 12 months old, she is now 15 months and loves it more now that she has gone up to another level!"
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,4,It is a good teether for my handicapped student. But the ability to bit down is required which is hard for my student.
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,4,"I have two of these teethers and both see variable use as my little guy goes through teething spurts.In between, he actually likes sitting or kneeling on the star to get it to vibrate.But as soon as his gums start hurting, he goes straight for this toy.Also, it's a smart packaging extra to have the 'free ring' on top which clearly doubles for hanging purposes."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,4,"Bought this based on the reviews. My daughter is an early teether at 3 months old. My only complaint is that she has a hard time activating the vibration by biting hard enough. This has allot to do with her age. I have to hold one of the corners for her to activate the vibration. She LOVES it, I only wish it had an on/off switch so I didn't have to hold it for her. She actually cries when I try to take it away from her."
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,4,"This thing is big. Baby can grow into it. It really does help when I hold it and turn it on for him. If he isn't done with it he is sure to let me know. Which to me translates that he likes it. I'm not sure how I feel about the sticky feeling plastic, seems unnecessary and everything sticks to it."
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,4,"It is a little awkward at first, but I had an extremely premature baby who was too small for the traditional carriers, and needed to be held all the time.  I lived, cooked, did laundry, ate, and slept with this sling for 2 months.  Once my baby was bigger and needed to be held less I started using other carriers.  But now I'm back to the sling because quite frankly, once you get the hang of it, its much, much easier to get baby in and out of it."
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Original Bassinet, Solid Toffee",4,"I love the idea of the co-sleeper. I've seen some other concept designs by other companies and I hope they follow through with them. Arm's Reach has a bit of a monopoly on the co-sleepers right now. My little one hasn't arrived yet, so I haven't actually used it yet. Assembly is REALLY confusing. I don't know what happened to my paper instructions, but I can't find them. Luckily, there are some on the AR web page. But it is still so confusing.For those of us who are ardent Attachment Parenting, this is ideal. My older son, 15 months old, is still in bed with us and this Arm's Reach will give us the extra space for two little ones. We used the Snuggle Nest when our older boy was a small infant and that worked great. With two though, I wanted to keep the older away from the younger while they slept but still near us.If attachment parenting is a new concept for you, I strongly encourage you to read as much as you can online. Arm's Reach co-sleeper is a great way to co-sleep without the fear of suffocation."
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,4,"I bought this for my son when he was 4 months. He is now 11 months and is not that enthused with it anymore. I liked this product because of the bright colors and the variety for him to play with. It is a very good toy, but my son doesn't have much interest in it. Nothing at all wrong with the toy, I would recommend it to anyone."
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,4,"This toy is so nice to have if you use your stroller a lot. My baby has loved playing with this and I have even given this as a gift. The only thing that I did not like was that the cup that is the bugs legs, comes out. That is great for cleaning but if the baby takes it out, it can become yet another thing to keep track of during your ever so busy outings. Overall, this is a great and cute idea and gives some added fun for babies stroller time."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"Ok - newsflash.  Diapers are just smelly.  We've had this pail for 2.5 years now.  It was our first and primary one.  There were no major smell problems until after one year, when our son started eating solids.  Also, we change the bag twice weekly as 3 days is about the max for smell-containment.  Around 20-22 months we started shopping for a container that would be less smelly and didn't find one as good.  (We have a cheaper one upstairs which broke immediately and always stunk!)  We finally just put the Diaper Champ in the attic a few months ago and use the cheap one with the flip-up lid - mainly since the cheapo fits inside the cabinet and we didn't notice a big difference in smell-control.  (The most helpful action is to tie the dirty diapers inside a small plastic bag before putting them in the pail.)A couple of our friends have this pail and were pleased until the children started eating solid food and things got stinkier - but that's pretty much the consensus according to many reviews on the different pails.  I've knocked off a star since the mechanism isn't that intuitive (to grandmothers and babysitters, at least) and it frequently gets stuck when the bag starts getting full.  Plus there are some smell issues, as with any pail.  However, the fact that you can use regular trash bags is so much more convenient!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"I waited to review this until I saw how it performed in the really-stinky-diaper stage.  Now, with my daughter at 1 year and eating lots of solids (and making really stinky diapers), I can happily recommend the diaper champ.  A couple suggestions: 1) as baby's poop gets stinkier, empty more often (at least once a week) and 2) every time you empty, spray with Lysol or similar product and wipe out with antibacterial cleaner.  This second step has kept the plastic from retaining a bad smell.I gave 4 stars because it's not ""perfect"" -- sometimes a little smell leaks out if it's very full.  But all around a good product, and not needing special refill bags is a huge benefit for a busy mom."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,We had 2 diaper Genie's both given to us as a gift but it was hard to use it since everytime you stuff the diaper in you have to turn it which cannot be done with one hand (required if you are holding your baby).  Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.  On top of that the refills are very expensive.  So we decided to buy Diaper Champ and so far we love it.  It is very easy to use with one hand.  I like the feature that you can acutally clean the chute if for some reason it gets messy.  Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.  It is very easy to use and does not smell unless the bag needs to be replaced and the most important part is that you can use your regular garbage bags (no need for expensive refills).
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"We bought this pail because it used regular trash bags and hoped it lived up to all it says - IT DOES!!  We use the scented trash bags and have had no trouble at all!  (It does get a little smelly when you change the bag, but that is expected)The only thing we don't like is the inside lid that holds the bag down. It does not stay up on its own.  So when you change bags it has to be held open with 1 hand-leaving only 1 hand to get the bag out.  It just makes it akward.My husband even recommends it!!  So it has to be good."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!) and it even takes the same bags as my kitchen trash can, shich is super convenient, and cost efficient as I can buy them in bulk.The only reason for not rating it a 5 star was that I did have one small problem with it. The foam gasket in the barrell which keeps the poopy smell inside the unit ripped somehow, and it got VERY stinky. HOWEVER, I contacted the manufacturer though their website, and received an email back the same day stating that this was unusual, and that replacement gaskets were on their way to me. They arrived inside of a week and after replacing, it works great again! (They even sent me extras should it happen again)I HIGHLY reccomend this diaper pail over ANY competitors, you will not be sorry!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"Granted our 3-month old isn't producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.  My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"Our daughter is 13 months old and we've been using the Diaper Champ ever since she was born. I highly recommend it because it's a great value.  However, there are a few things to be aware of which is why I only gave 4 stars.1. Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC. My husband learned the hard way that the grips get stuck on the seal and the diaper won't drop into the bag.  Then you have to pull the diaper out and the grips slowly pull away the seal.  It didn't seem to affect the odor control, but it did make it difficult to move the handle/shoot back and forth.  The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2. The unit is top heavy when it's empty. I learned this one the hard way.  When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.  Ouch!!3. No, the stink isn't completely trapped, but it's pretty darn close! The stinkiest part is emptying a full bag.  I found that putting a stick-up inside the lid has made it much more tolerable."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"I chose the Diaper Champ over the Diaper Genie because of its money-saving feature of being able to accomodate most plastic bags with handles.  (The Genie requires use of their own bags.)  The plastic bags that work best are the larger kinds like the ones you get from Toys R Us or Ikea.  The plastic supermarket bags are a little too small.In regards to odor control, the DC has been successful for 3/4 of the year.  There is a noticeable smell during the summertime, so I've had to change the bags more frequently on hot days or else face the consequence of suffering the aroma of baking poop.My only negative comment about this product is concerning the lid.  For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.  Even though I have short, uncared for nails, I've had a few bent nails from trying to pull open the lid.  Then, the next problem is that the lid doesn't open all the way (like a cigarette lighter).  It opens up to about a 75 degree angle.  This makes it inconvenient when you are trying to remove a stuffed bag of diapers.  Also, the underside of the lid has several plastic sharp juttings against which my hands would occasionally get scratched.  And, during the removal of the full bag, this is when you get the full blast of your little one's excretions (quite possibly 3-5 days worth of them), so hold your breath!Although there is room for improvement on this design, I haven't seen or heard of any other model that can do this job nearly as well for as reasonable a price."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"I love the convenience of not having to buy special bags.  I got my Diaper Champ as a hand-me-down from a relative, and it still works great.  There is no diaper odor in our nursery.  When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!).If you don't clean things, they don't smell clean.  This isn't rocket science.The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because I don't like the opening mechanism on the front.  But I can't think of any way they could've done it differently that would be as effective."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"In reading some of the other reviews, I think it's all been said but I guess I'll say it again anyway.  :)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.  My husband and I tend to let it get to the point that we have to actually push the plunger down to get the diaper to go in and still the nursery is odor-free for playing or sleeping.  And I must admit, I have a 1 yr. old who eats everything under the sun and even when it comes time to change the bag, it's not that bad.  Tie it up fast and you're good to go. ;)  I will admit that it can be hard to open, but if it were easier, I'd have dirty diapers strung from one end of the room to the other because of my busy boy!!!  I highly recommend the Diaper Champ!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"I checked out all of the available diaper disposal systems.  This by far is the best, no refillable special bags, no stink, and very easy to use.  It is great! Those exploding diapers for newborns can't even crack this."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"Thank goodness we found something better and easier than ""genie""!!This one works great, no difficulty loading bags or putting diapers in.Only reason for not 5 stars is a little odor escapes but in my opinion well worth the offsetting ease of use."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"I changed my registry from the Diaper Genie to the Diaper Champ after reading the reviews for the Diaper Champ online. I'm very happy with it. Our baby's cradle is in our room so we keep the Champ in there with us. There are no odor problems whatsoever. I also love that you don't have to buy specialty bags for this pail.The only caution I give is to moms with long natural or fake nails...the opening latch doesn't release very smoothly. When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply. I have short nails but I can imagine long nails might get broken or fake ones snapped off if care isn't taken when opening the top.Also, the diaper disposal mechanism, which is great (!!!) since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep. Just be sure to dispose of your diaper(s) before putting baby down to sleep.I would recommend this product to everyone, even with these two very minor issues."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,I chose the Diaper Champ because you are able to use standard trash bags.  I hate to buy replacement items such as bags ( i usually forget).  I works great.  The only thing is when it is full it is full.  It is very difficult to squeeze anything else into it.  I have not noticed any lingering oder in the baby's room and would recommend this item.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"We got the Diaper Champ as a gift and immediately fell in love with it.  I wish I had invented this product.  It is one of our Top 10 items to buy.It takes regular kitchen trash bags and is really quite good about the smell.  Now that we are introducing Isabella to more foods we are finding that it does not contain the smell as well, but better than anything else that we use.The only problem I run into this that it gets stuck on the inside from time to time at the worst possible moment -- stinky full diaper that needs to disappear right now!  I am pregnant again so these smells get to me.  Because of this problem I gave it 4 stars.It gets stuck from an occasional diaper sticky tab sticking to the inside .  When this happens, you have open everything up and it can get a little messy if the tab was stuck in the wrong placeWe also own a Diaper Genie which is 99% smell proof, but also has it's own problems.  I would only buy this one, even if money, space and smell were not an issue."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"I love my Diaper Champ. My son is 3 months old and we have had a great experience with it. It's simple to use and is cost efficient. The biggest plus to this diaper pail is that you can use any plastic bag you want. As far as some people saying it smells, I haven't had a problem. Once a week I soak it with Lysol and water to keep germs away. I highly recommed this product if you want a clean, simple, and convenient diaper pail!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"I love the diaper champ.  I registered for this item because I liked the fact that it takes regular garbage bags.  When it's almost full it tends to have a bit of an odor, but lysol takes care of that, and helps kill germs.  This is very easy to use and is simple to change.  I highly recommend the diaper champ."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,love it because it uses the bags from the grocery store.  way cheaper than others.  have to change regulary (2 times per week) when the baby gets on solids though.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"As much as I hear you all on the Diaper Champ - it is fabulous - the SMELL factor is greatly reduced when you take the trouble to empty diapers into the lavatory first.  This is what you are SUPPOSED to be doing.  Feces should NOT go into landfills because they can carry bacteria and intestinal viruses which can filter into, and contaminate, groundwater and soils.  Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!  Please be more conscientious!  Do your part and put the poop in the pot and help to preserve our precious planet for that little person whose bottom you are currently managing."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"I got this for my daughter and I just think it's great. We have this in her room and I haven't smelled any ordors coming from it except for when you open it up to take out the bag. I also love the fact that you can use just regular bags. I know of someone that had a diaper genie and she still had a diaper in it from when her baby was born and she was about 2 months at that time. I've found that when it starts getting alittle full just shake it to level the diapers out and you will be able to get more in there. I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven't had to try this yet. I would highly recommend this to anyone."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"I have to say I really like the Diaper Champ, with one exception-it is definitely NOT always odor free.  I have had to put it in the bathroom now instead of the baby room, because smells from &quot;stinky&quot; diapers will seep out.  I think the best advice is to wrap the really smelly ones in a plastic bag before putting them in. Another word of advice-keep a can of Lysol next to it to spray when you throw a diaper away. It can also be hard to open-I've broken several nails on it.  I've only had it a few weeks (I've been using it for my toddler's diapers until my new baby comes), and I'm hoping that the latch on it loosens up a bit with opening and shutting. Otherwise, it's great that it holds more diapers, and it's SO much easier to put the diapers in it than the Diaper Genie I had.  I don't need two hands for it!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"I love this diaper pail. Yea, if you let poopy diapers sit in it for too long and don't change the bag on a regular basis it will start to stink but  c'mon its a bucket full of poopy diapers.As you child grows, or if you have older children watch out. The handle system fascinates  little ones and they find it amusing that they can put something in, flip it and it disappears,  which is good when it's a diaper, bad when it's,,, your keys."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"This diaper pail is great. It is the third one that I have tried. I just wish that I had it 4 years ago with my first child. It is very easy to use. You don't need special liners or refills. A regular garbage bag works fine. I had the Diaper Genie and it didn't keep odors out. The Diaper Champ doesn't totally keep odors away, but it works just as well if not better than the others I have tried. The diaper champ is very easy to use. You only need one hand to ""operate"" it. My 2 year old loves ""helping"" out and can independently use it."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"Let's face it.  This is a specially designed garbage can to hold human feces.  One cannot expect that it will be odor free.  Mine certainly isn't.  It is my fault, though.  If I emptied the bag more often, there would not be a stench.  But alas, I am lazy.  So when I do change the bag, I also spray some lysol.  Works for me.  I like it that you just have to flip the handle for the diaper to go bye bye.When I first got the product, I really hurt my finger trying to open the thing.  But that was my own fault.  I did not have it on the floor.  When opening the lid, step on the stabilizer ring at the bottom of the unit and it opens with ease.I too love that you do not have to buy special bags for this.  What a pain to have to remember to buy and then spend five bucks a pop on Genie bags.  Thanks, but no.All in all, I really like my Diaper Champ.  It's also taller than the genie which is good for me, I don't have to bend over so much to flip the lid."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,GOOD POINTS:Easy to operate and change.Less expensive to use than comperable products.Kept smell in for several months as other products did.We were unable to break it after 10 mos unlike competitors.BAD POINTS:Toddler kept flipping it back and forth and touching where we put the diapers.Did not keep room odor free after several mos of use.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,I love this diaper pail. It keeps the diapers from stinking up your room/house. I also love that I can use regualer old kitchen bags and dont' have to fork over extra bucks for special bags. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that I wish that it held more diapers.
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"I have been very happy with this pail.  The greatest thing... regular trash bags!!  The Next greatest thing... 1 handed operation & it takes only a SECOND! Awesome!I have not had any issues with odor.  I change the bag every 5-6 days or so.  If the plunger is not going down, it's because you need to change the bag!!The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because changing the bag takes a few minutes.  It can be difficult to open, ALthough, when my daughter gets older and starts getting into things, this will probably be a blessing! :)"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"My husband saw this after my first shower and said ""What's that thing for?""  He now loves it.  I do too.  Best of all, you don't have to buy specific bags, we use the bags from the grocery and they do quite well.  We've bought some air freshener cans and put them in the bottom, because after 8 months of use, it's going to smell.  But the room does not carry the smell, only when you're on the floor near the genie.  My only issue is that I've broken a nail or two lifting the latch to get the top open.  But it's infinitely better than having the smell!!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"My husband and I originally registered for the Diaper Genie, but we changed our minds when we considered that we would only be able to use the Diaper Genie refills.  The Diaper Champ allows you to use regular garbage bags.  Plus it's simple to use.  We haven't had a problem with odor at all.  It's a great product!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"We have ours in our living room and you can't smell a thing.  It is a little difficult to open and it doesn't hold a lot of diapers, but overall it works well."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"The boy is now 1 year old and we have had it since the beginning.  I remember reading a good review about the Diaper Champ and deciding to get it.Honestly, it does a great job.  It does contain the odor to inside the Champ.  I have never noticed a smell in the room, even when it is full.  I have to admit, however, that when you open that bad boy up to empty it, it's pretty funky, but what do you expect?If you wrap up your diapers good and empty it before it gets so full that you can't squeeze another diaper into it, you will really be happy.  It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.  We use the scented bags, which we think helps a lot.Overall, we are very pleased with the Diaper Champ and would recommend it highly! (Only reason I rated it 4out of 5 stars is - nothing's perfect, I have a hard time giving out 5 to anything!)"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"My son is now 5 mo. and overall, I'm happy with the diaper champ.  I would not recommend wasting money on the types that require special bags. Do not kid yourself that you will have an odor-free diaper pail--I do not think that is possible!  I would rate this as low-odor--I change the bag about once a week.  My complaint, though, is that the plunger-cylinder thing gets stuck because the diapers begin to stack on top of one-another even when the bag is newly-changed.  Also, I do not use the plunger for messy diapers because if the tabs are nor fastened, the tabs get stuck in the plunger thing.  I do not wrap up the messy ones because of the leak factor, so I wind up having to open the lid frequently. The lid is a bit difficult to open, but I like that because when my little guy is more mobile he won't be able to open it!"
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"I like BabyTrend's products. We also have a SnapNGo, and we also seriously considered the Trend High Chair. We've been using the Diaper Champ for almost a year now since our baby was born. I think it does what it advertises and that is that it does a good job of keeping in the odors (we live in a 1 bedroom condo). Pros: easy to use one-hand drop-in mechanism, good odor trapping, can use just about any kind of grocery or plastic bag, convenient handle, and easy to clean. Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing. Hint: If using spray cleaning, don't spray water into the drop-in hole. The mechanism is not completely watertight and you'll trap some water in there. Myself, I've actually done a thorough cleaning only twice. Most times I just spray Lysol inside after changing to a new plastic bag."
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,4,"The Diaper Champ doesn't smell - how wonderful!  Also, there are no expensive bags to buy for it - you can use regular plastic bags!  Although it seems to fill up quickly(diapers tend to pile up in the middle), this is an absolute must!"
